00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:27,957

190

193
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I see.</b></font>

194
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:15,887
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He has a good memory, but since he
doesn't study his grades aren't good.</b></font>

195
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:21,957
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But he has a high IQ,

196
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:29,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He may have exceptional spatial cognition.</b></font>

197
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:34,367
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When did he start driving?</b></font>

198
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:40,507
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Well, umm, I can't say this too loud</b></font>

199
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,377
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but probably sometime during

200
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:44,667
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Wow</b></font>

201
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:49,287
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's not even funny.</b></font>

202
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:54,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It all started out of his kindness.</b></font>

203
00:17:55,127 --> 00:18:00,957
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I was raising him all by myself,

204
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:07,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He probably couldn't stand watching me drive while I was fighting to stay awake.</b></font>

205
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:20,877
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I remember very well that I was

206
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:32,817
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I drove in the morning because traffic was heavy, so he only drove at night.</b></font>

207
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:39,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I see. That's why he's
unusually fast on the downhill.</b></font>

208
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:46,677
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Now I know the reason behind Shinji's speed.</b></font>

209
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:50,807
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He learned mountain pass driving
as if he was playing a game.</b></font>

210
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:16,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His steering work is the product
of constant repetitive training.</b></font>

211
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,217
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's like a refined art.</b></font>

212
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,217
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Why is he so fast?</b></font>

213
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:33,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think you have a point when
it comes to him playing a game.</b></font>

214
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,517
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He looked happy every time he drove.</b></font>

215
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:45,227
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That car is a treasure of my late husband.</b></font>

216
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:54,087
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Because he was a rally driver, I have some knowledge about technique</b></font>

217
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,857
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I didn't teach him anything.</b></font>

218
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:01,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I didn't even give him any advice.</b></font>

219
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:08,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His driving is completely self taught,

220
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's a natural born talent.</b></font>

00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:17,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've been watching him drive

222
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:20,957
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>the center of his technique is no-brake driving.</b></font>

223
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,127
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No braking?</b></font>

224
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:29,177
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Using the brakes as little as

225
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,957
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's nonsense from a
driving technique standpoint</b></font>

226
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:38,727
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but his goal was never speed.</b></font>

227
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He doesn't use the accelerator very often.</b></font>

228
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:46,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Because it's the downhill, he can use inertia.</b></font>

229
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:51,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>While focusing on steering, he tries to
find the lines that he can drive smoothly.</b></font>

230
00:20:55,757 --> 00:21:00,627
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When he's at the wheel, you can sleep comfortably in the passenger seat.</b></font>

231
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:05,767
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We're home, Mom.</b></font>

239
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,497

240
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:42,957
