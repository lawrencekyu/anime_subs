everyone else does the same.</b></font>

123
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:32,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're only supposed to appear like that to
a special someone in a dark private room!</b></font>

124

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I feel the same way, Iketani!</b></font>

125

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You do understand, huh?</b></font>

126
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:41,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In short, they're just jealous.</b></font>

127

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Maybe I should become a priest.

128
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:46,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You're right.</b></font>

129
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:57,174
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm sorry.</b></font>

130
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:01,744

132
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:09,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This's incredible for us. Before, we
only chatted at a family restaurant.</b></font>

133

135
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:23,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Right. This almost feels unreal.</b></font>

137
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:36,014

139
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think it's because of his confidence.</b></font>

140
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:50,594
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's fulfilling his duty

142
00:09:55,474 --> 00:10:00,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He did grow up.

145
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,924

146
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,914

156
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:59,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh, Takumi, wait.</b></font>

157
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Umm, you see</b></font>

158
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:06,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Can you just call me "Mika,"

159
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Go ahead.</b></font>

162
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,304

163
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:56,404

167
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but probably not until the final step.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It can't be helped.

171
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:45,574

00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:05,614

178
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh, I heard it's going to be Hakone.</b></font>

179
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:25,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Better!</b></font>

180
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:29,974
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Right on. Your adjustment

188
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:09,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes. If you drive on the circuit, you get used to safety, and grow fearful of mountain passes.</b></font>

193
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,914

247
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:38,204

254
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:10,284

255
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:14,174
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But it's no longer mysterious to me.</b></font>

256
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:18,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The turning ability is simply a matter of tire capacity and load balance</b></font>

262
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:55,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The upper section is wider for faster speed.</b></font>

263
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:58,374
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The middle part is a super slow section with continuous tight corners.</b></font>

264
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:04,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And the lower part is a middle speed section where you can
step on the gas even though the road is somewhat narrow.</b></font>

265
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:10,834
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Although circuit racers would

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The range of speed is 
too low in mountain passes.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If the average speed was faster,

268
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:20,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I won't use that as an excuse.</b></font>

269
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:23,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The last section is the decisive point.</b></font>

270
00:20:23,664 --> 00:20:26,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If I were Fujiwara, I'd make my move there.</b></font>

271

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He has to. This is when he

273
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I have this eerie feeling.</b></font>

274
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We might end up seeing it on this course.</b></font>

275
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>See it, you mean...</b></font>

276
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:52,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh no, I'm not really
good with those things.</b></font>

277
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,284
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You idiot. 
I never said you'd see a ghost.</b></font>

278

279
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:11,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I doubt such artistic control
actually contributes to his speed.</b></font>

280
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:17,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Race car drivers don't play around.</b></font>

281
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Faster or not, that's all that matters.</b></font>

282
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:25,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>My brother calls it the Fujiwara Zone</b></font>

283
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:29,224
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but it's not exactly the same 
as the ones used by top athletes.</b></font>

284
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:33,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's a phenomenon that only occurs

285
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What kind of phenomenon is it?</b></font>

286
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,894
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's difficult to explain,

287
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:40,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm not so sure either.</b></font>

288
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:48,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But when I drive behind Fujiwara during practice,
 there are moments that catch me off guard.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He pulls away for some

290
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I thought it was like a mirage.</b></font>

00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:57,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You never know when you'll get to see it.</b></font>

292
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But there's a Fujiwara Zone for sure.</b></font>

293
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,054
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He shows it when a certain 
set of conditions are met.</b></font>

294
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:08,594
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's important is the 
unique rhythm of the course.</b></font>

295
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What was that? My mistake?</b></font>

296
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can't let my guard down.</b></font>

297

298
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Again? He pulled away at the exit.</b></font>

299
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:35,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Was it my mistake?

300
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:38,954
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What bothers me most is that I'm upset.</b></font>

301
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I might have gotten carried away by his pace.</b></font>

302
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A point where his rhythm changes?</b></font>

303
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:54,304
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes. From a rhythmic repetition of stepping
on the gas, then releasing it right away</b></font>

304
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>to a rhythm of delaying the release a bit.</b></font>

305
00:22:56,734 --> 00:23:00,224
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The two cars are right at that point.</b></font>

306
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:02,924

307
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Something? What is it?</b></font>

308
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The peak of the Fujiwara Zone.</b></font>

309

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've always wanted to ask you.
What exactly is it?</b></font>

310

he did it a long time ago.</b></font>

311
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:23,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When I raced against him on 
Akina, I caught a glimpse of it.</b></font>

313
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:37,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Simply put, it's his level 
of training in the Eight-Six.</b></font>

314
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:42,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When it comes to Fujiwara, his level
is beyond our normal imagination.</b></font>

315
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:46,154
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It must be the result of his
abnormal practice environment.</b></font>

316
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:51,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You said he heard the voice of the
Eight-Six during the previous battle.</b></font>

317
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:55,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In the auto industry, they often use the phrase, "The driver and the car as one"</b></font>

318

00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:19,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He can also freely switch between the
side for turning and the slide for acceleration.</b></font>

322
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:25,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As a result, what happens is that

323
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No way, that's not possible.</b></font>

324
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Of course it's not.</b></font>

325
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:33,954

326
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:39,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What I mean is that the Eight-Six maneuvers
so sharply that it creates such an illusion.</b></font>
