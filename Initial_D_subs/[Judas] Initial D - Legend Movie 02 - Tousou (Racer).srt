168
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You shouldn't do this because
 the GT-R is a nasty opponent.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You're only doing this

171
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:40,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You're clueless about cars, so you don't know how great the GT-R is, like a class of its own.</font>

172
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:48,817
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's got the combined advantage of FR and 4WD thanks to the electrically-controlled torque-split 4WD system.</font>

173
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,687
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's also fast on the downhill because of superb stability.</font>

176
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:10,027
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six is totally outclassed.</font>

177
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:15,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Besides, your opponent is a famous
 street racer. This race is really unfair.</font>

178
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:22,877
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You made a name by defeating the
 Akagi Red Suns, so you'd better cherish it.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Yeah, he took off looking really uptight.
 I don't know what's going on.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{aitsu}I never expected him to go

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Bunta, he'll be racing against a GT-R. 
Did you give him any advice ?</font>

277
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:40,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It's meaningless to

00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:15,357

 it reminds me that his drift is an art.</font>

283
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:19,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Even I can't control my FC like that at the limit.</font>

284
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:24,097
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">But wouldn't a non-turbo Eight-Six eventually lose because of the lack of power ?</font>

285
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:33,167
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">A turbo is a powerful aid in straightaways, but its
 power will make the car unstable at the exit of corners.</font>

286
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,177
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's a double-edge sword.</font>

287
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:41,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">But once you get the Eight-Six at the right angle, you can step on the gas as you like.</font>

288
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:46,997
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">In a technical course, an under-powered car can be faster if you can be aggressive on the accelerator.</font>

289
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:56,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Come to think of it, I could barely use the full

290
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:59,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You go boom, and you have to brake right after.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{partial}It was also frustrating that I had 
to use partial throttle so often.{quite a lot.}</font>

292

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That's the nature of the FR layout.</font>

293
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:08,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Nature of the FR ?</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Wait, Brother ! 
What about the GT-R's 4WD ?!</font>

295
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:19,067
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Its ATTESA E-TS can let you step on the gas without losing control, so you can use the turbo power as much as you like.</font>

296
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:30,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">This is it.</font></font>

297

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">This feeling of high tension, like
 the blood in my entire body is boiling.</font></font>

00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:38,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">This is a battle !</font></font>

299
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,057
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six is falling behind.</font>

300
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:47,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Nakazato may be a big talker, but he's good.</font>

301
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:51,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">He minimizes the under-steer by 
transferring the weight skillfully.</font>

302
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:54,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's the type of driving that
makes use of the GT-R's power.</font>

303
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:58,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{omoshiromi}It looks boring, but he doesn't drive wastefully, giving no overtaking opportunities.{It looks boring, but the defense is 
tight because the style is efficient.}</font>

304
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,597
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You can't be so relaxed, Brother.</font>

305
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:06,877
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It'd be humiliating to allow the 
Night Kids to defeat the Eight-Six.</font>

306
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,977
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I doubt that will happen.</font>

307
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:14,757
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The first half has many 
straightaways and the slopes are mild.</font>

308
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:19,627
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The slope is steep in the second half, and that's where the downhill specialist will show his true potential.</font>

309
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:33,787
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">What amazing drift !</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">In order for the under-powered Eight-Six to
 maintain speed he avoids wasteful deceleration.</font></font>

369
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:12,727
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{mudana}That's why he uses drift.</font></font>

370
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:21,447
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's in a class of his own. This has 
nothing to do with vehicle performance.</font></font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{ano}That bastard must have a few screws loose !</font></font>

00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:38,767
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Dammit !
 I'm so glad to be alive !</font>

375
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:47,737
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I wonder where Takumi is at right now ?</font>

376
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:52,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Given the incredible speed,
 he must have gone down quite far.</font>

377
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,067
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">If that Eight-Six turns out

380
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:11,567
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Simply put, the body weight.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Body weight ?</font>

382
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:19,437
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The GT-R's weakness is under-steering
 because of its super heavy front section.</font>

383
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:22,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Even if you try to mitigate it 
with tuning or driving technique...</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{kihon}...you can't change the basic characteristics.</font>

385
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:30,727
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If you continue a forceful steering manner as you use the ABS on the hard downhill...</font>

00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:34,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{kanarazu}...the front tires and brakes will lose their grip.</font>

387
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:41,727
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">By the time you reach the bottom, you'll be 
fighting under-steering at the entrance of corners.</font>

388
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:45,447
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Even with a well-tuned brake system.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The response from the front has become dull. 
It's slightly under-steering.</font>

390

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The stress to the front 
tires was greater than expected.</font>

391
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:03,117
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">This is gonna be tough.</font>

00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:25,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I saw you overtake Takahashi 
Keisuke in these five hairpin curves.</font>

397
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:31,827
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You only have to keep the inside closed. I'll never open the inside no matter what.</font>

398

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">What the...?</font>

401
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:46,077

402
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:49,797
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That was insane. 
It drifted through this narrow road.</font>

403
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:52,047
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">From the outside again ?</font></font>

404
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,047
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It's so annoying !</font></font>

405
00:34:56,147 --> 00:35:01,177
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The GT-R's motion is unstable. 
Nakazato must be losing concentration.</font>

406
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:05,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Keisuke, the Eight-Six's going

407
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:11,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I see.</font></font>

408
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:16,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">
Because I'm trying to block the inside too much, I'm not 
braking hard enough and I'm not taking the ideal cornering line.{Because I forced myself into staying close to the inside, I took an abnormal path, which resulted in a loose entry.}</font></font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{out}He's taking the outer line,

00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,587
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It's gone. Where...where is it?</font></font>

412
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">The outer line was a feint motion !</font></font>

00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,497
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff"> He changed his line while full braking{ full } ?!</font></font>

414
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:44,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That was a brilliant move, but...</font>

00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,467
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'll show you the true potential of the RB26 !</font>

417
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:20,167
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It lost...?
The GT-R lost...</font></font>

00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:26,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">No, that's not it. 
I'm the one who lost.</font></font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">The GT-R didn't lose to the Eight-Six.</font></font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It's a shock, but somehow it feels good.</font></font>

421
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I did everything I could.</font></font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That was fun, wasn't it, Keisuke ?</font>

425
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That was great.</font>

426
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:57,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It pressured the GT-R really 
hard during braking on the downhill.</font>

427
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:01,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six must have
high-performance ABS.</font>

428
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:06,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">What're you talking about ? 
You think the Eight-Six has ABS ?</font>

429
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:11,407
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The driver's right foot is superior
to machine-controlled ABS.</font>

430
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:18,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I haven't been this excited in a long time. 
I have to rewrite a big chunk of my paper.</font>

431
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:24,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That Eight-Six is a really worthy target to defeat.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Brother...</font>

00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:35,597
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Are you serious ?</font>

00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:36,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'm checking now.</font>

437
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:38,137
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Apparently, it's true.</font>

438
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,097
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It can't be true.</font>

439
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:40,217
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">No way.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Looks like you are the one
 who was humiliated, Takeshi.</font></font>

441
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,137
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">You can't act tough for quite a while.</font></font>

442
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:16,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">When I defeat the Eight-Six, then I, Shoji Shingo, will become the leader of the Night Kids.</font></font>

443
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:23,567
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Just wait, Eight-Six. I'll send you to the junk yard by fighting under emotional, yet dangerous rules.</font></font>

444
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Eat one.</font>

445
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:37,637
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

446
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:41,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Hot...</font>

447
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:51,127
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">This is awkward.
 I've begun to look at you differently.</font>

448
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Huh ? What do you mean ?</font>

449
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:56,127
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Right now, you're the usual Takumi.</font>

450
00:38:56,127 --> 00:39:00,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">But once you get in the Eight-Six and are 
thrust into the night mountain pass...</font>

451
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,317
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{imaya}...you become an admirable
 hero of Akina's street racers.</font>

452
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:06,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Huh ? Really ?</font>

453
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:09,957
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That's what this is all about ?
 You make me feel embarrassed, Itsuki.</font>

454
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:13,217
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Although you're just an airhead
 munching on a sweet bun right now.</font>

455
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">"Airhead," you say ?</font>

456
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,067
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I feel awkward, too.</font>

457
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:26,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">But if someone becomes happy because of what I do, that makes me really happy.</font>

458
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:31,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I see. I didn't know you were the
 type who'd do things for others.</font>

459
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:36,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Driving is slowly becoming fun.</font>

460

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Iketani's car is repaired.</font>

461
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,457
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That's good.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Let's go to Akina tonight.</font>

463

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Sure. {this can be omitted}</font>

464
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:12,877
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You look happy.</font>

465
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Of course. 
I finally got my baby back.</font>

466
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The S13 Silvia, that is.</font>

467
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:36,757
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">When did it...?!</font>

468
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:44,437
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It tapped my bumper.</font>

469
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:46,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You want me to move because I'm too slow ?</font>

470
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:47,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Screw you !</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Itsuki, Iketani, are you alright ?</font>

473
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:30,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'm fine, more or less.</font>

474
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,637
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Apologize ? 
You've gotta be kidding.</font>

475
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:50,707

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Like I said before, it was your fault.</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If you lose, you'll kneel 
down and apologize, right ?</font>

<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Wait, you said something about rules.</font>

491
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:09,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's really not a big deal.</font>

492
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:12,147
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">We call it the gum tape{duct tape} death match.</font>

493
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:18,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{migite}You tape your right hand
 to the steering wheel and race.</font>

494
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:19,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That's all.</font>

495
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:33,887
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Stop. Don't do this, Takumi.</font>

496
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:36,127
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">This's insane. It's so risky.</font>

497
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:38,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You know what this means ?{ You can't}</font>

498
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You can't steer as much !</font>

499
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:46,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If you can't do that how are you
 going to clear the corners ?!</font>

500
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,517
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">But the conditions will be equal.</font>

501
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:53,937
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">He must have practiced !
That's why he brought up a rule like this !</font>

502
00:43:53,937 --> 00:43:57,677
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">This's just too risky, even for you !
Please don't, Takumi !</font>

503
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I won't quit, Iketani.</font>

504
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:04,067
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I don't know why, but I don't want 
to lose to that guy no matter what.</font>

505
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:07,177
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Takumi...</font>

506
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:10,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You can go first, Eight-Six boy.</font>

507
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:12,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Go !</font>

508
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:18,527
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">They're off.</font>

509
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:19,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">We've gotta go, too !</font>

510
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,427
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Impossible !
 We'll never catch them !</font>

511
00:44:22,097 --> 00:44:24,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'm not thinking about catching them !</font>

512
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:27,537
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If Takumi crashes, I want to
 help him as soon as possible !</font>

513
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:36,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">There's no need for two downhill specialists.</font>

514
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:43,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">This EG6 Civic driver Shoji Shingo of the Myogi 
Night Kids is the fastest downhill driver in Gunma.</font>

515
00:44:44,357 --> 00:44:47,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Let's see how many corners you can clear.</font>

516
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:57,257
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">You're done.{over.}</font></font>

517
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:14,757
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Damn, how did he recover from that ?</font></font>

518
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:16,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">But it's only a matter of time.</font></font>

519
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:25,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">No matter how good the driver is, you must apply a 
counter-steer to stop the over-steering of an FR car.</font>

520
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:29,487
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Right, but the Civic is an FF, so...</font>

521
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:33,707
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{over-steer}...you can stop over-steering with the accelerator, 
so you can dive into corners more aggressively.</font>

522
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:37,557
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{side}And you can mitigate under-steering 
by pulling the parking brake.</font>

523
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:41,057
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Under this rule, you'll crash
 unless you drive an FF car.</font>

524
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:46,017
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If someone can avoid an accident
 in an FR car, he must be a monster.</font>

525
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:56,557
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I feel so uneasy after every corner because
 I might see a wrecked Eight-Six at any moment.</font>

526
00:45:57,307 --> 00:46:01,757
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I feel like he's gonna be alright.
 It's Takumi, after all.</font></font>

527
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:11,597
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Why ? Why can he turn ?</font></font>

528
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:16,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">The gum tape{duct tape} death match is not
 easy for a first timer to manage.</font></font>

529
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:25,817
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">See ? I can pass you
 any time if I want to.</font></font>

530
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:32,487
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Why don't you feel the heat ?
 Attack harder and crash.</font></font>

531
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I can go...</font></font>

532
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,097
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">...faster than usual.</font></font>

533
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:00,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I can go faster if I depend less on the steering.</font></font>

534
00:47:09,307 --> 00:47:10,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">What the hell ?</font></font>

535
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:13,357
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">No matter how much pressure 
I put on him, he remains stable.</font></font>

536
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:15,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">In fact, he's getting faster.</font></font>

537
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:29,637
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I don't give a damn ! 
Victory is all that matters in a battle...</font>

538
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{donna}...regardless of how !</font>

539
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:51,107
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Damn, what a lucky ass brat.</font>

540
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:53,767
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Well then, I'll just pull away right here !</font>

541
00:47:56,657 --> 00:48:00,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">This is it. The sound of the engine
 revving all the way up to the red zone.</font></font>

542
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:04,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{kono}I just can't get enough 
of this intoxicating feeling !</font></font>

543
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:17,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">You did that on purpose.</font></font>

544
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:22,757
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I will not lose to a scumbag
 like you, no matter what !</font>

545
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:46,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">No way ! 
How can he keep up ?!</font>

546
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,857
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'm driving at my ultimate speed !</font>

547
00:48:54,507 --> 00:48:57,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">What's going on with that Eight-Six ?</font></font>

548
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:01,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's not using the steering...</font></font>

549
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:05,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">...but turning by only shifting the weight !{the weight shift !}</font></font>

550
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:36,237
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">What the hell was that ?! 
How did he pass me in a place like that ?!</font>

551
00:49:50,677 --> 00:49:54,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">If I lose the very gum{duct} 
tape death match I set up...</font></font>

552
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:01,827
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">...I'll be a laughingstock among my team members, and never be able to redeem myself.</font></font>

553
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:07,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I have to save my rep even 
if that means I have to resort to a tie.</font></font>

554
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:12,247
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">The end of this battle is a double crash !</font>

555
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,377
<font size="58" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">My EG6...</font></font>

556
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:32,407
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Ouch. You really blew it.{You've done it.}</font>

557
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,767
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Hey, are you alright ? Are you hurt ?</font>

558
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:42,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I think my right arm is broken because
 of the kickback from the steering wheel.</font>

559
00:51:43,177 --> 00:51:49,077
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Hop in. I'll take you to the hospital. 
It's faster than calling an ambulance.</font>

560
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:51,377
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I can't owe you that much.</font>

561
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:53,457
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Don't be so hard on yourself.</font>

562
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:58,357
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It hurts, right ? 
 We'll take care of the mess here.</font>

563
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:00,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">We're used to things like this.</font>

564
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:04,457
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Don't be a stranger.
 Crashes happen to anyone.</font>

565
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:07,217
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">We are locals, so we know
 the emergency hospital.</font>

566
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:09,877
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">As he says.</font>

567
00:52:14,037 --> 00:52:16,357
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Thanks, I owe you one.</font>

568
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:26,187
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">So Takumi won.</font>

569
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">He's incredible, isn't he ?</font>

570
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:59,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I ended up facing a really annoying a-hole, 
and I snapped during the race.</font>

571
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:02,957
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{sono}After that, I don't remember what happened.</font>

572
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:07,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">When we lose ourselves, both you
 and I don't know when to stop.</font>

573
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,857
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{daga}But I'd never damage the car.</font>

574
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">So, did you win ?</font>

575
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:18,827
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Yeah. {this can be omitted}</font>

576
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:23,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

577
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:35,657
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Like Itsuki and Iketani say, street racers 
love cars and take good care of them, but I...</font>

578
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:43,557
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.</font>

579
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:07,507
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's worn out real bad.</font>

580
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,907
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I might as well replace it while
 the car's in the body shop.</font>

581
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:17,517
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's hot again today.</font>

582
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:25,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You're incredible.</font>

583
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:31,467
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">No street racer will challenge
 you to a downhill battle in Akina.</font>

584
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:32,927
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I don't think so.</font>

585
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:38,717
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">There're plenty of good drivers in
 Gunma, because its skill level is high.</font>

586
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:42,317
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I don't think Takahashi Ryosuke
 of the Red Suns can remain quiet.</font>

587
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,807
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Takahashi Ryosuke, huh ?</font>

588
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:50,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Speaking of which, he's fast.</font>

589
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:56,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">When I was fighting the GT-R,
 a white RX7 was right on my tail.</font>

590
00:54:57,507 --> 00:55:01,307
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I was occupied chasing the GT-R at the time...</font>

591
00:55:01,307 --> 00:55:04,257
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{atode}...but looking back on it, he concerns me.</font>

592
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:11,057
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">{ore}I know for sure. He's really fast,
 faster than anyone we've ever seen.</font>

593
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:14,597
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I see. Probably so.</font>

594
00:55:14,597 --> 00:55:21,577
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Hey, Takumi, what would you do if 
a great racer like him challenged you ?</font>

595
00:55:22,507 --> 00:55:25,557
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You won't accept, right ?</font>

596
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">If that happens...</font>

597
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:34,077
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">...I'll take a shot.</font>

598
00:55:41,127 --> 00:55:42,627
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">I finally found you !</font>

599
00:55:44,117 --> 00:55:45,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Mogi...?</font>

600
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:46,607
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Why are you here ?</font>

601
00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:55,437
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">You only mentioned "gas station," so I've been looking for your work place for a long time.</font>

602
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:56,207
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Why ?</font>

603
00:55:56,827 --> 00:56:00,407
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Because I wanted to see you at work.</font>

604
00:56:01,897 --> 00:56:04,567
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Itsuki, who is she ?</font>

605
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:07,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">A classmate, but um...</font>

606
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:09,577
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Your bellybutton's showing.</font>

607
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:13,007
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">That's fine.
 This's how it's supposed to look.</font>

608
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:18,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Hello. I have a flower delivery,
 and need your signature.</font>

609
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:23,157
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">It's addressed to Mr. Panda Trueno.</font>

610
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,047
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Panda Trueno...?</font>

611
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:27,667
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Takumi, that must be you.</font>

612
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:28,587
<font size="58" color="#ffff00">Me ?</font>

613
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:32,007
