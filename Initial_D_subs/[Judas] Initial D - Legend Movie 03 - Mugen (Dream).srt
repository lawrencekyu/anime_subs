 become a festival site again.</font>

130
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:48,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Your son has changed so much.
 He became Akina's hero in just one summer.</font>

131
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,167
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">His driving has changed.</font>

132
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:59,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He was just a good driver, 
but he drives fast these days.</font>

133
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:02,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He broke through a wall, which is a good sign.</font>

134
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:20,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, Bunta.
 Did you plan all this from the beginning...</font>

135
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...ever since you decided to 
let Takumi handle the delivery ?</font>

136
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What do you mean ?</font>

137
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:29,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Like telling him to drive without spilling water in the cup, so he wouldn't damage the tofu.</font>

138
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:34,887
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{honto}But you wanted to teach him the
 basics of weight transfer, didn't you ?</font>

139

140
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:44,687
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I think I was more concerned 
about the tofu in the beginning.</font>

141
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But Takumi has <i>it.</i></font>

142
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:55,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Eventually, I did start tuning the suspension, brakes, and transmission to match his growth.</font>

143
00:11:55,457 --> 00:12:00,887
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I admit I changed his driving style to my liking.</font>

144
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:07,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What's the purpose ? Why are you 
giving him special driving training ?</font>

145
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:10,537
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I don't have any purpose, really.</font>

146
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:16,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's just fun to watch him getting better and better.</font>

147
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:20,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He'll eventually surpass me, 
and do what he likes to do.</font>

148
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:26,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Whatever it is, I hope 
he'll be ready, since I wasn't.</font>

149
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,417
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

150

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The view from here hasn't changed at all, 
even though the world's changing so rapidly.</font>

151
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:46,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">We stayed in this city, and we're exactly 
the same as we were in the old days.</font>

152
00:12:57,697 --> 00:13:02,687
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Iketani, I'm still not up for it.</font>

153
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:07,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I don't think I can drive your car well because I've never driven anything other than the Eight-Six.</font>

154
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:13,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I beg you, Takumi. I think I can learn
a lot, even if you just cruise around.</font>

155
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">So, what do you want me to do then ?</font>

156
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:20,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Braking drift.
 I want to learn the timing.</font>

157
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,127
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

158
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:26,027
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">H...hey, we're going for it already ?</font>

159

<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">This feels way too fast !</font></font>

160
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:43,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It sounds pretty good, whoever is driving.</font>

161
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:46,847
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Well, I'd better get going.
 I have to check the updated suspension.</font>

162
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:50,867

163

<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Incredible. Just like Itsuki said, 
whether it's the Eight-Five or the Silvia...</font></font>

164
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">...he's fast, even when it's his first time.{in his first drive.}</font></font>

165
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's incredibly fast.</font></font>

166
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">But I feel safe for some reason.</font></font>

167
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:24,767
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">So it's true. You don't feel scared
 when a skilled driver goes fast.</font></font>

168
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:31,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's a little different from my dad's car,
 but now I know how to drive this.</font>

169
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,167
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm going to try drifting.</font>

170
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:38,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You're going to ?! 
Then what were you doing back there ?!</font>

171
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:55,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Here it comes !
His entry speed's just incredible !</font></font>

172
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What the hell are you doing, Bunta ?!</font>

173
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,947
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I need a smoke.</font>

174
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:13,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I...I...In the middle of drifting ?!</font>

175
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:20,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Oh, no !</font></font>

176
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Oh well, good enough.</font>

177
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Now, I'd better get serious.</font>

178
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:38,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You really haven't changed since the old days !</font>

179
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:42,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Let me get out !</font>

180
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Oh man, what a terrible night.</font></font>

181
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:06,287
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">They say you don't feel fear 
when a skilled driver goes fast, but...</font></font>

182
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:09,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">That's a total lie.</font></font>

183
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:14,047
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Bunta's super crazy when
 it comes to pursuing speed.</font></font>

184

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Akagi's White Comet ?</font>

186
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:31,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">People call Takahashi Ryosuke that ?</font>

187
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,737
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yeah. It was about three years ago...</font>

188
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Akagi's level was already high.</font>

189
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:42,567
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Then word spread quickly when a
super fast white FC3S showed up.</font>

190
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,297
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That was the lone wolf Takahashi Ryosuke.</font>

191
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:50,337
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The "lone wolf" ?
 What about the Akagi Red Suns ?</font>

192
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:56,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takahashi Ryosuke formed the Red Suns later. 
The goal was to perfect driving technique.</font>

193
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:01,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They participate in gymkhana and circuit runs.</font>

194
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:05,697
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The team's fundamentally different 
from the usual groups of friends.</font>

195
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:09,227
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's why their level is so high.</font>

196
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:16,957
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Together with his brother Keisuke, they're now known as the Takahashi Brothers, but to me...</font>

197
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:20,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...Akagi's White Comet sounds right.</font>

198
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:25,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takahashi Ryosuke's charisma is unmatched in Gunma.</font>

199
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Akagi's White Comet, huh ?
 Sounds awesome.</font>

200
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:35,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">This Saturday's battle is getting more interesting.{, isn't it Takumi ? Right ?}</font>

201
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Right, Takumi ?</font>

202
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,467
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Isn't it ?</font>

203
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:40,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Huh ?</font>

204
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Where is that low tension coming from ?</font>

205
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:46,367
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You said you were excited the other day !</font>

206

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Are you going to be alright ?</font>

207
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:05,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I heard this at the shop.</font>

208
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:10,887
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Is it true that Ryosuke turned down
an offer from a professional team ?</font>

209
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yeah, it's true.</font>

210
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

211
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:19,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Is it because it's hard to strike a
 balance with his med school studies ?</font>

212
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That'd be a piece of cake for my brother.</font>

213
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:23,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Then why ?</font>

214
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:30,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">RS Giga is an elite team with stellar 
achievements in production car racing at Fuji.{???}</font>

215
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:35,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Becoming a pro driver, stepping into 
the spotlight, and getting recognized...</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{hashiriya}That's the success story 
every street racer dreams of.</font>

217
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,957

 in the world of the pros.</font>

218
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:48,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Then why is he so into
 gymkhanas and circuit runs ?</font>

219
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:50,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What's the reason ?</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The public street...</font>

221

 Is your FC ready ?</font>

00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:29,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yeah. I'm going to take
 it for a spin on Mt. Akagi.</font>

228
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Don't be surprised, Keisuke.</font>

229
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:52,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's got 260 hp at the maximum.</font>

230
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You dropped it from 340 hp ?!</font>

231
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What's the point of slowing the car down ?</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{After the battle against him,} You must've learned the lesson

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{kudari}Total balance is the key to
 mastering the downhill, not power.</font>

234
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:12,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Sometimes you have to lower the power to go faster, which makes street racing complex.</font>

235
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:18,357
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">So Akina's Eight-Six is a formidable opponent ?</font>

00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You could say that.</font>

237
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:29,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I was confident I could manage big power on the downhill, so this de-tune is humiliating.</font>

238
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:34,847

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">There's another reason 
why I dropped the FC's power.</font>

241
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:06,937
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">If I just out-power the Eight-Six on

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{saikin}Lately, I've been thinking about
 him a lot, and feeling uneasy.</font>

254
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Maybe this is pressure.</font>

255
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Is that it ?</font>

256
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:32,547
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Cars have to be fast ?</font>

257
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,167
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">If you don't like it, just ignore it.</font>

258
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:41,447
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Just because someone challenged
 you doesn't mean you have to take it.</font>

259
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:46,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I don't hate it.
 I don't know if I can win, but...</font>

260
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...I have no intention of running away.</font>

261
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,067
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's so you, Takumi.</font>

262
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:59,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Deep down, you're really eager to race, right ?</font>

263
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:06,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You look modest,
 but you're a very competitive type.</font>

264
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I've known all along.</font>

265
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:13,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I wasn't the soccer club's 
manager for no reason.</font>

266
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Wanna head home ?</font>

267
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:29,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Just a little longer, let's talk 
just a little bit longer in the car.</font>

268
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,167
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

269
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:38,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I know one more thing.</font>

270
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:49,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I know why you punched an older student in the soccer club's locker room.</font>

271
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:56,827
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">A junior student told me what really 
happened long after you quit the club.</font>

272
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:02,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Natsuki's body's just gorgeous.</font>

273
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I can't get enough of this.</font>

274
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:07,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, I'll have dirty thoughts every
 time I see Mogi's face from now on.</font>

275
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:08,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Don't be so envious.</font>

276
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:10,827
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The other day...</font>

277
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:16,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Cut your dirty talk.</font>

278
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It gets on my nerves !</font>

279
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What's wrong, Fujiwara ?!
 I'm dating Natsuki !</font>

280
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'll say whatever I want !</font>

281
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:28,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Besides, how can you talk 
to senior students like that ?</font>

282
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:31,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Like I care ?!</font>

283
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:40,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You got angry for my sake.</font>

284
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:43,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Sorry, I misunderstood you for a long time.</font>

285
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:47,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's okay. It doesn't matter now.</font>

286
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">See ?
 Something's wrong with Takumi.</font>

287
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm sure of it.</font>

288
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,787
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Now that you mentioned it...</font>

289
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:54,417
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But Takumi's always spaced out.</font>

290
00:25:54,897 --> 00:26:00,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He's even worse lately. 
Almost completely out of it.</font>

291
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:05,727
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">At first, I thought he was concerned
 about tomorrow's battle, but...</font>

292
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:07,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's not ? Then what is it ?</font>

293
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Remember what Kenji said earlier ?</font>

294
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:19,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You mean about how Kenji's friend
 saw a panda Trueno with a girl inside ?</font>

295
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:22,617
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, why can't Takumi have a girlfriend ?</font>

296
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:25,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Stop. I know what's going on.</font>

297
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:27,887
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He must be lost in love.</font>

298
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He is ?!</font>

299
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,297
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Welcome.</font>

300
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:40,537
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">High octane, right ?</font>

301
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:41,947
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yup. Fill it up.</font>

302
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:43,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Right away.</font>

303
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">No need to clean the glass.</font>

304
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,447
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Okay. Thanks.</font>

305
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:52,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, being love sick the day 
before a battle is pretty bad.</font>

306
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What should we do, Iketani ?</font>

307
00:26:56,617 --> 00:27:01,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I want romance. A passionate one.</font>

308
00:27:01,457 --> 00:27:03,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">This isn't the time for that.</font>

309
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,987
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'll take care of this...</font>

310
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:12,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...while being completely free from personal envy like
 "How come he's the only lucky one ?!"</font>

311
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">So, what's this about ?{'s the business ?}</font>

312
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:28,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You've been seeing a girl lately, 
without telling me{ lately}, haven't you ?</font>

313
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I didn't mean to keep it a secret from you.</font>

314
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:35,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But I don't have to report to you, do I ?</font>

315
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">No excuses. 
Just answer my questions.</font>

316
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:41,997
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">So, how far have you gone ? 
Be honest.</font>

317
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:45,567
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">How far...? 
Up to Akina Lake.</font>

318
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:49,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You moron, that's not what I meant !</font>

319
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:52,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, watch out !
 Itsuki, watch where you're going !</font>

320
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:57,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You must have kissed her already, I suppose.</font>

321
00:27:58,207 --> 00:27:59,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I did.</font>

322
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What the hell...?!</font>

323
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Stop that ! I mean it !</font>

324
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:12,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takumi, you've been acting
 weird for the last few days.</font>

325
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:16,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I've been thinking about something for a while.</font>

326
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:21,147
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I know. It's not about
 tomorrow's battle, is it ?</font>

327
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:27,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You're right. I've been thinking
 about what comes after that.</font>

328
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:29,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">After that ?</font>

329
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:36,367
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">How dare you say that to someone like me who 
hasn't had a girlfriend for 18 years and counting !</font>

330
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:39,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">There's only one thing after a kiss.</font>

331
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:42,447
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">A hotel, right{you know} ? A hotel !</font>

332
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,347
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What are you talking about ?</font>

333
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:49,767
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm talking about what will 
happen after tomorrow's battle.</font>

334
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:56,447
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I don't have any concrete vision, 
so it keeps bugging me.</font>

335
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Huh ? What're you talking about ?</font>

336
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,487
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Don't you see what I mean ?</font>

337
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:07,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">No, I don't. You think there has
 to be something after the battle ?</font>

338
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:12,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You don't need anything. 
You're already fast enough.</font>

339
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">No, I'm not.</font>

340
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:17,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You are.</font>

341
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:22,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Seriously, Takumi, please stop thinking
 about the small stuff and focus on the battle.</font>

342
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:25,697
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">By this time tomorrow, 
you and Takahashi Ryosuke...</font>

343
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">A car's climbing up.</font>

344
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:33,047
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Not one, but two cars.</font>

345
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:53,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's Takahashi Keisuke's FD.</font>

346
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:56,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">And that black GT-R must be 
Nakazato Takeshi of the Night Kids.</font>

347
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:04,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Why are they racing on Akina ?</font>

348
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:07,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That surprised me !</font>

349
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:12,927
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They looked so amazing from the outside. 
Those cars are going very fast.</font>

350
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:17,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What're you talking about ? 
You look much cooler on the downhill.</font>

351
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Have you forgotten ?</font>

352
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:23,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You beat those two.</font>

353
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:28,047
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">My victory was under a specific condition...</font>

354
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:34,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...but those guys are fast wherever they go.</font>

355
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm so curious about that Eight-Six.</font>

356
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:19,767
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It makes me come to Mt. Akina, 
hoping that I can meet it again.</font>

357
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:22,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Nakazato...</font>

358
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:27,357
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Our team has a downhill specialist named Shingo.</font>

359
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:29,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He has a terrible personality, but great skills.</font>

360
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:37,327
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He was defeated by Akina's Eight-Six recently, 
but he happily praises the Eight-Six driver's skills.</font>

361
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:42,727
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He hardly ever compliments
 anyone because he's so full of himself.</font>

362
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:46,537
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That Eight-Six has a charm like that.</font>

363
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:53,267
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Once you race him and see his drift before your eyes,
 you'll be mesmerized by his splendid maneuvers.</font>

364
00:31:55,507 --> 00:32:00,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I don't want him to be 
defeated by anyone but me.</font>

365
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,247
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">No matter who his opponent is.</font>

366
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six is totally exposed.</font>

367
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:10,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">My brother has already completed 
his simulation for victory in his head.</font>

368
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,577
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I can't think of him losing.</font>

369
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:27,927
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Both of them are in a class of their own, 
but when they race, one of them will lose.</font></font>

370
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:33,467
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I don't want to see 
their battle for some reason.</font></font>

371
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You know boys...</font>

372
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:47,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They like cars.</font>

373
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:50,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Are they that interesting ?</font>

374
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:54,977
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Sure they are. 
You can go anywhere you like.</font>

375
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:56,617
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Is that all ?</font>

376
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">There's more to it.</font>

377
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:02,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Any licensed driver can drive a car, but...</font>

378
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:07,937
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...only a handful can truly master driving.</font>

379
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I've been thinking a lot about things like that...</font>

380
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:17,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...wondering what I should 
do to become a faster driver.</font>

381
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:23,347
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I feel good thinking about things like that.</font>

382
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:28,227
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takumi, you're a pervert.</font>

383
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,867
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Where did that come from ?!{What's with you, all of a sudden ?}</font>

384
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I see. I finally figured it out.</font>

385
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:36,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I've been wondering why, but...</font>

386
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I know the secret of your pheromones.</font>

387
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You're answering your own question !</font>

388
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:45,017
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I have no idea what you're talking about !</font>

389
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:46,427
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Never mind. Never mind.</font>

390
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:49,587
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Sheesh.</font>

391
00:33:56,217 --> 00:34:00,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Your race is tonight, isn't it ?</font>

392
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yup.</font>

393
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,817
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I've seen an accident.</font>

394
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:13,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You can lose, but don't crash no matter what.</font>

395
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,087
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{yakusoku}Promise ?</font>

396
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:06,787
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The moment of truth has come.</font>

397
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:07,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

398
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:12,097
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Undefeated street racer
 Takahashi Ryosuke of the Akagi Red Suns...</font>

399
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:17,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...and Akina's dazzling new star, who drives the Eight-Six and defeated Takahashi Keisuke and Nakazato Takeshi.</font>

400
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,817
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">This match'll decide Gunma's fastest driver.</font>

401
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:37,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Hey, Mako, don't you think the mood is stuffy ?</font>

402
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:41,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Is Akina always like this ?</font>

403
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I feel odd.</font>

404
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:48,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Whoever wins, it'll{I'd} be hard on us.</font>

405
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:54,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Same here. Takahashi Ryosuke and 
Akina's Eight-Six driver aren't just fast.</font>

406
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:58,257
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They're charismatic drivers with mysterious appeal.</font>

407
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:03,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I feel like something will 
change when the battle ends.</font>

408
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:07,747
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I see...</font>

409
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:38,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Newbies like to watch from 
way up there, which is so typical.</font>

410
00:36:39,977 --> 00:36:41,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The battle won't be decided up there.</font>

411
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:45,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">This's the only spot where they can make a move.</font>

412
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's your prediction as well, Shingo ?</font>

413
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:52,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Just like you, I'd say.</font>

414
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:54,457
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You too.</font>

415
00:37:03,627 --> 00:37:06,357
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takumi isn't here yet.</font>

416
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I can't take this heavy mood.</font>

417
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:13,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The gallery along the course is huge.</font>

418
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:20,347
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Iketani, what brings so many people here ?</font>

419
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:25,027
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Well, it could be a yearning.</font>

420
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:27,087
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">A yearning...?</font>

421
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:32,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">A yearning for the super technique demonstrated by Takahashi Ryosuke and Takumi.</font>

422
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:38,667
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Everyone gathered here likes cars so much.</font>

423
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,847
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Here comes the panda Trueno !</font>

424
00:37:57,847 --> 00:38:00,377
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's Akina's downhill specialist, huh ?</font>

425
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:04,667
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Once you see his splendid drift,
 you'll dream about it !</font>

426
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:15,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Finally, the crowd's pumped up, Sayuki.</font>

427
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,127
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He's good.</font>

428
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:22,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Keisuke, I've been thinking 
about this for a long time.</font>

429
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:25,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">When I lose in street racing, I'll retire.</font>

430
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:30,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What's gotten in to you, all of a sudden ?</font>

431
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,337
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You can't lose.</font>

432
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:39,297
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'll leave the front lines, and pursue my project for 
the fastest team in the Kanto area in a different way.</font>

433
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:44,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But what'll happen to the Red Suns if you quit ?</font>

434
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:47,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">We have you.</font>

435
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:51,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm...I'm no match for you, Brother.</font>

436
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:56,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">We need you when the stakes are high.</font>

437
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:04,937
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Only two drivers have made 
me feel that I'll eventually lose.</font>

438
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:08,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">One of them is you, Keisuke.</font>

439
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:10,407
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Me ?</font>

440
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:13,537
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">And the other one...</font>

441
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:38,607
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Don't worry. 
I don't think I'll lose any time soon.</font>

442
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:44,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Takumi !</font>

443
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:48,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Tonight, I'll drive at full throttle.</font>

444
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:51,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It'll be fun.</font>

445
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:25,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm going to count down !</font>

446
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">In five...</font>

447
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:33,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Four...</font>

448
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:34,367
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Three...</font>

449
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:35,557
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Two...</font>

450
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:36,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">One...</font>

451
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:37,667
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Go !</font>

452
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:45,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's begun ! It's the best downhill battle 
in the history of Mt. Akina street racing !</font>

453
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:48,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six's fighting 
an equal battle with the FC !</font>

454
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:51,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Go, Takumi !</font>

455
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:56,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">My brother's standard 
strategy in an important battle.</font></font>

456
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:59,767
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{wazato}He deliberately lets his opponent take the lead, and then overtakes them.</font></font>

457
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,227
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's defeated all his opponents that way.</font></font>

458
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The Eight-Six is ahead.</font>

459
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:27,357
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What an incredible super twin drift.
 They almost touched.</font>

460
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:30,327
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Both of them are showing
 their best from the beginning.</font>

461
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:44,647
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Both of them are so incredible !{It's just so incredible. Both of them.}</font>

462
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:50,027
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But Takahashi Ryosuke usually
 doesn't use drift that much.</font>

463
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:55,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">He must be trying to win in the field his opponent is best at for him to remain king of the street.</font>

464
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:02,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Amazing. The angle of his counter steer is smaller than half a month ago.</font></font>

465
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:06,307
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{turn-in}His tendency of taking a wide 
counter steer during the turn-in is gone.</font></font>

466
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,587
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{wazuka}He grew in such a short period of time.</font></font>

467
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:14,127
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{daga}But that won't change the result. I'll still win.</font></font>

468
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:45,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's staying right behind me.</font></font>

469
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:07,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Are you serious ?</font>

470
00:43:07,657 --> 00:43:13,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They skidded all the way through
 this tricky downward complex curve.</font>

471
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But it must be tough for the Eight-Six driver to have his opponent right behind him.</font>

472
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:23,757
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Right. The chaser has the advantage
 in both technique and mentality.</font>

473
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:26,057
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">{hashiriya}That's a street racer standard.</font>

474
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">On top of that, 
his opponent is Takahashi Ryosuke.</font>

475
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,727
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The pressure must be enormous.</font>

476
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:41,157
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's so good that he gives me chills.</font></font>

477
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,187
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Beginners are only fast on the straightaways.</font></font>

478
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:47,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Mid-level racers know the corners.</font></font>

479
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:53,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{jokyuu}Top-level racers accel in the third point, 
which isn't a straightaway or curve.</font></font>

480
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:58,667
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{sono}The main theme of my fastest street racing theory is to perfect that third point.</font></font>

481
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:04,417
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{sono}I've found a near perfect 
sample in a place like this.</font></font>

482
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:10,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{koushite}I can only keep up with him because
 I'm copying his line and rhythm.</font></font>

483
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:13,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{tandoku}But it'd be difficult for me to do the same alone.</font></font>

484
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:16,577
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">{osoroshii}He's frighteningly good.</font></font>

485
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:21,727
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">It's no good, I can't shake him !</font></font>

486
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:28,857
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">What ?! Are you sure
 about your section time ?!</font>

487
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:31,507
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#a9f4f5">I thought I messed up...</font></font>

488
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:35,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">...but they're eight seconds
 faster than our first match here.</font>

489
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:36,907
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Eight seconds ?</font>

490
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Eight seconds faster than Keisuke's time ?</font>

491
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:45,027
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">What's happening to those two cars ?</font></font>

492
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:52,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I'm not done yet ! I still have <i>it </i>!</font></font>

493
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,377
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">My gutter run didn't work.</font></font>

494
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:10,377
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">He's not an opponent I can defeat after all.</font></font>

495
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:15,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">I'm going to lose this battle. 
I hate it, but I'm going to lose.</font></font>

496
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:23,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">That's right.
 If they reach the goal at this pace...</font>

497
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:28,137
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#a9f4f5">...they can shorten the 
course record by 12 seconds.</font></font>

498
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Gimme a break. This is madness.</font>

499
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,007
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">This is too much.{enough.}</font>

500
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,627
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Yeah, I have a bad feeling.</font>

501
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:43,807
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">It's the ultimate all-out battle
 that only those two could pull off.</font>

502
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Tonight's battle will become legendary for sure.</font>

503
00:45:49,697 --> 00:45:50,727
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Takumi...</font></font>

504
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:00,707
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">They're approaching the five consecutive hairpins.</font>

505
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:04,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I'm looking forward to their hard braking match just before the first corner.</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">I can't believe this. 
The Eight-Six under-steered.</font>

511
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:39,547
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">So no street racer can escape

517

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Better than I've heard. Their speed range is
 way higher than that of the average drift brats.</font>

518
00:47:10,757 --> 00:47:15,107
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But it's over, right ?

520
00:47:17,657 --> 00:47:21,887
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">But the Eight-Six's line is slightly better.</font>

00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:41,207
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">There's no difference in speed.</font></font>

524
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:44,777
<font size="42" color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffffff">Then I should shorten the

532
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:53,257

533
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:58,617
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">Judging from the squealing sound, the
 battle must be deadlocked as expected.</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The goal is right ahead. This's the only point where they can make a risky final maneuver.</font>

535

enough speed for a braking contest.</font>

<font size="42" color="#ffff00">You can't overtake from the outside !

545
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:05,657
<font size="42" color="#ffff00">The FC's sliding ! He'll miss the
 clipping point and lose momentum !</font>
