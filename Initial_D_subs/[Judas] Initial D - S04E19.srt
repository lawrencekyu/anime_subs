171

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In any case, Keisuke's FD

173
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:28,944

174
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:30,984

175
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>so this tire balance relies too much on the rear.</b></font>

176
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:35,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Should we raise the back area a bit?</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Please do.</b></font>

178

240
00:18:56,014 --> 00:19:01,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No, Fujiwara. This is my order as team leader.</b></font>

241
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:06,754
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We are in that season. With days as hot

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's important you be rested to

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'll take you to the bed-and-breakfast,

248
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:39,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I feel bad for the others,</b></font>

249

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You said it. This is the first time, isn't it?

251
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:54,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Still, this course will make it

00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:58,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's pretty short, but it has some

253
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:02,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There are lots of corners with lazy turns

254
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:08,644
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The roads have lots of twists... It doesn't

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>That was fast! The idiot's already asleep!</i></b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>I'm way more sensitive...</i></b></font>

259
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What is that boy Kenta doing?</b></font>

260
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:40,244
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He said he put some tanning oil on

261
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:44,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Idiot. What does he want to get any darker for?</b></font>

262
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,254
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Anyway, these days sure have gotten hot.</b></font>

263
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:50,954
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Being inside our cars
would be unbearable, huh?</b></font>

264
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:56,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It was a good call, having Keisuke

265
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:02,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's right. This race will require

266
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:08,644
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He even thought this part through.

267
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes, indeed...</b></font>

268
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:58,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara sure is taking his

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He doesn't seem to be coming back, does he?</b></font>

270
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:04,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keisuke breezed through it

271
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not a competition, you know.</b></font>

272
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:12,344
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've got my own pace. I may be fast,

273
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:17,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Well, do your best. You'll be racing first today.</b></font>

274
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:18,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Just leave it to me!</b></font>

275
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:22,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I slept nice and cool,

280
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:13,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Seriously, what do you think about Project D?</b></font>

281
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:17,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Can their drivers compete with the
duo that people refer to as gods?!</b></font>

282
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:20,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're no ordinary racers, that's for sure.</b></font>

283
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:24,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Both of them are young guys still in their 20s,</b></font>

284
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but they've been to all the

286
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:32,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then they'd better give it their all.</b></font>

287
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:36,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>After all, we came here to watch the gods race!</b></font>

288
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There sure are a lot of onlookers.</b></font>

289
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:44,194
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah. Having too many people
here would just cause problems,</b></font>

290
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:50,204
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>so apparently D didn't advertise the time

291
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:54,944
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Still, there are fansites out there

292
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:59,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh, really? It sure is rough.</b></font>

303
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Is that acceptable?</b></font>

304
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:41,754
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, sure. It's a combined stage

305
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:44,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>For the first race, I'd like to lead.</b></font>
