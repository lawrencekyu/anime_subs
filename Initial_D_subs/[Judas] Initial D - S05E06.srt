00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:23,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He won't lose. 
Takumi will never lose.</b></font>

242
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:30,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Okay, I got it, so don't cry, Itsuki. 
I know how you feel.</b></font>

243
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:37,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Itsuki is right.
We've got to see the final race.</b></font>

244
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:40,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We have to see the end, no matter what.</b></font>

245
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:53,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm the team leader, Ikeda Ryuji. 
Thanks for coming all the way here.</b></font>

246
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:58,894
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Nice to meet you. 
I'm Takahashi Ryosuke of Project D.</b></font>

247
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>These are our drivers.</b></font>

248
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:05,324
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'mTakahashi Keisuke.</b></font>

249
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm Fujiwara Takumi.</b></font>

250
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So you guys are Project D.</b></font>

251
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:16,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I have a favor, or more
like a question to ask.</b></font>

252
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Just tell me what
pops into your head.</b></font>

253
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:21,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What is driving to you?</b></font>

254
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:29,124
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Let me hear your answer.
Takahashi Keisuke, you go first.</b></font>

255
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:34,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In short, proof of masochism.</b></font>

256
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:39,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's interesting. 
How about you, Fujiwara?</b></font>

257
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:44,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>To me, it's a daily activity, 
like washing my face.</b></font>

258
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's interesting, too.
And finally, you?</b></font>

259
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:52,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm not a driver here, 
but should I answer?</b></font>

260
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,394
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'd love to hear it.</b></font>

261
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:01,434
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A dream.</b></font>

262
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:19,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Okuyama didn't show up, after all.</b></font>

263
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:24,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As he puts it, he can't find any
reason to greet his opponent.</b></font>

264
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:28,304
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If that's how he raises
his motivation, that's fine.</b></font>

265
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:34,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Besides, Sakamoto, did you 
sense anything from Project D?</b></font>

266
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:39,584
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Their presence gives me chills. It must 
come from the momentum of continuous wins.</b></font>

267
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:47,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And yet, they aren't desperate,
or aggressive toward their opponent.</b></font>

268
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:52,434
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're so calm that they look 
more pro than the real ones.</b></font>

269
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:57,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think you're right. Those three
are top notch public street racers.</b></font>

270
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:04,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is the perfect stage to test my
Zero theory, which I've been advocating.</b></font>

271
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:09,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The key is to free yourself from
destruction before you begin the race.</b></font>

272
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:15,424
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I believe that the ideal driving style can be 
achieved through a mental state of zero noise.</b></font>

273
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:24,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The air is moist, so it'll rain from dawn through
the day tomorrow, like the weather forecast said.</b></font>

274
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:30,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Wet conditions will probably benefit the
locals, because they know the course.</b></font>

275
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:33,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Generally, that would be true</b></font>

276
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:38,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but Team Spiral tends to 
rely on their cars potential</b></font>

277
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:41,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>so they probably don't like rain.</b></font>

278
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:49,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I originally thought Project D's Eight-Six
driver would have a tough time if it was dry.</b></font>

279
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:53,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Compared to Okuyama's car, the
difference in performance is just too big.</b></font>

280
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:58,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But in rain, it will equal out.</b></font>

281
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:02,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Plus, I can think of another
condition, besides the rain.</b></font>

282
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:09,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In that case, Okuyama won't be
able to defeat Project D's lad.</b></font>

283
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:36,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Following the brake light of the front car.</b></font>

284
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:42,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.</b></font>

285
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:46,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's the silence like a silent film.</b></font>

286
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:52,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The light was all I could depend on.</b></font>

287
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:58,244
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I felt like I could catch it,</b></font>

288
00:25:58,244 --> 00:26:01,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>if I passed through this tree lined street.</b></font>

289
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:05,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Get up! I just can't understand.</b></font>

290
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:11,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.</b></font>

291
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,354
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, it starts at this moment.</b></font>

292
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:19,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>At this place.</b></font>

293
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:22,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Please turn over the flyleaf.</b></font>

294
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:32,254
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I lost my way.</b></font>

295
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:35,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fogged up windows, and</b></font>

296
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:38,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>messed up navigation.</b></font>

297
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:42,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As the stoplight turns red</b></font>

298
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:48,984
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.</b></font>

299
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:54,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I gradually close the window</b></font>

300

301
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,194
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Get up! I just can't understand.</b></font>

302
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:07,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.</b></font>

303
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:10,984
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, it starts at this moment.</b></font>

304
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:14,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Because you're with me.</b></font>
