00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Let me see your proud sprint dash.</b></font>

123
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:56,244
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Are you telling me to be the lead?</b></font>

124
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:59,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Alright, but do you think
you can keep up with me?</b></font>

125
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:01,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Shut the hell up.</b></font>

126
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,374
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Listen, Kenta</b></font>

127
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,324
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes?</b></font>

128
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:13,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This battle has a special meaning to me.</b></font>

129
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:14,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Do you understand?</b></font>

130
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:15,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I do.</b></font>

131
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:19,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Watch me.
I'll win no matter what.</b></font>

132
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I wonder how Takumi's race went.</b></font>

133
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:27,304
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He should give us a call.</b></font>

134
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:30,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's dense when it 
comes to things like this.</b></font>

135
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He doesn't understand our concern.</b></font>

136
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:36,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, but it's pointless to get frustrated.</b></font>

137
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:41,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not just Takumi, Takahashi Keisuke's
going up against a pro racer too, right?</b></font>

138
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:46,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Right. Neither Takumi nor Takahashi 
Keisuke can let their guard down.</b></font>

139
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:49,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Geez, I'm so pumped up!</b></font>

140
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Five seconds till start!</b></font>

141
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:57,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Three</b></font>

142
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:58,834
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Two</b></font>

143
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>One</b></font>

144
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Go!</b></font>

145
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:17,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Why do I feel so irritated,
or is it more like vicious?</b></font>

146
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I want a complete victory over you.</b></font>

147
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:29,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I know what Keisuke means by special.</b></font>

148
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's because his opponent today is a pro.</b></font>

149
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:38,904
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's trying to test his skills against a pro.</b></font>

150
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:48,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No matter how many amateur 
4WD drivers you've defeated</b></font>

151
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>amateurs can't use the
full potential of their cars.</b></font>

152
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:56,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If I dash when the tires
are in their best condition,</b></font>

153
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I should be able to overtake
you even with my heavy 80 Supra.</b></font>

154
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:06,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The battle between rear wheel drive cars boils
down to the game of conserving the rear tires.</b></font>

155
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:18,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You can't attain real tire management skills 
unless you take part in professional racing.</b></font>

156
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:24,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You'll wear out your rear tires
by trying too hard in the first run.</b></font>

157
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:29,284
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then the proud speed brat of the
 mountain passes will be finished.</b></font>

158
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Hey, do you remember</b></font>

159
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:48,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>the second round of the battle
against the Todo School in Tochigi?</b></font>

160
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:51,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In that complex stage
of uphill and downhill</b></font>

161
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:58,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>everyone thought you'd choose Keisuke's FD
against the racing driver, Tachi Tomoyuki.</b></font>

162
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:04,084
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But you chose Fujiwara's Eight-Six.</b></font>

163
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,804
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Your explanation was so 
sensational that I couldn't forget.</b></font>

164
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:13,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You said you're using two approaches in your 
pursuit of the fastest record in street racing.</b></font>

165
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:17,274
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's why there are two drivers in Project D.</b></font>

166
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh, that.
I'm amazed you remember that.</b></font>

167
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:26,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Of course I did.
It sounded so meaningful.</b></font>

168
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:31,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara is a peculiar type, who
specializes in mountain passes.</b></font>

169
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:34,804
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And I think he's become
exactly as you described.</b></font>

170
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:42,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>On the other hand, Keisuke is a traditional type,
who adapts racing techniques to the street.</b></font>

171
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:48,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You chose Fujiwara because we wouldn't have stood
a chance against a pro in a clash of traditional skills.</b></font>

172
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I did say that.</b></font>

173
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then what'll happen during today's battle?</b></font>

174
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:01,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Today's opponent has top level traditional skills.</b></font>

175
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:10,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The Eight-Six kid won the downhill battle,
but I wonder how the hill climb round will develop.</b></font>

176
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:14,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This time I want to 
hear your prediction, Hojo.</b></font>

177
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:20,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Minagawa is a proud person, so he
doesn't think he can lose to an amateur.</b></font>

178
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:24,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But the younger Takahashi is a
better driver than Minagawa thinks.</b></font>

179
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:29,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's well trained, especially his acceleration work.</b></font>

180
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:34,704
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's why that FD's been undefeated so far.</b></font>

181
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I see.</b></font>

182
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,894
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Plus, he's backed by Ryosuke.</b></font>

183
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:45,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't think he'd send his brother
into a race without a strategy.</b></font>

184
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I feel the same way.</b></font>

185
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:53,584
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This battle will be tangled up. It's a big 
mistake to think Minagawa will win easily.</b></font>

186
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Whose side are you on, Hojo?</b></font>

187
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:03,054
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What happened between you and
our opponent's leader in the past?</b></font>

188
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:07,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There's nothing important
between Ryosuke and I.</b></font>

189
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:12,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's my older brother who has a
bitter connection to Ryosuke.</b></font>

190
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,964
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The driver who's nicknamed the Grim Reaper?</b></font>

191
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:28,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The FD is the lead? Minagawa
must have chosen to be the chaser.</b></font>

192
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:34,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Their positions in the first round will be the key to the outcome of this race.</b></font>

193
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As expected, he's got more horsepower.</b></font>

194
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:46,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But that doesn't mean much in this battle.</b></font>

195
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Both of us are well aware of that.</b></font>

196
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:59,974
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Indeed, our opponent is a
top class traditional driver.</b></font>

197
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:03,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>With competition trained skills,
he won't show any weakness.</b></font>

198
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:09,804
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The sense of shaving time off, 
mental ease at the limit, and stamina.</b></font>

199
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:15,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Those things can't be 
attained by street racers.</b></font>

200
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:20,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It'd be the right strategy for us to throw
a change up, instead of a fast ball</b></font>

201
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:22,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but we don't have that kind of choice with Keisuke.</b></font>

202
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:27,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So I've sent Keisuke out with confidence</b></font>

203
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,424
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>because Keisuke has grown.</b></font>

204
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:40,944
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Special menu? Like a boot camp?</b></font>

205
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:41,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Right.</b></font>

206
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:50,304
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It will be extremely difficult to continue defeating 
powerful 4WD cars with your rear wheel drive FD3S.</b></font>

207
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:55,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The key is how effectively
you use the rear tires.</b></font>

208
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This training is for that.</b></font>

209
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:00,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Just five round trips
a day should be fine.</b></font>

210
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:05,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Try to match the times I've set for the
ten laps of uphill and downhill driving.</b></font>

211
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:11,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Write every time down in this notebook,
and show it to me every day.</b></font>

212
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:19,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If there's a noticeable gap between my preset time and
your actual time, try to figure out why, and report in detail.</b></font>

213
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's all.</b></font>

214
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:28,194
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fine by me, but these times are quite
a bit slower than Akagi's best record.</b></font>

215
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Don't you think this is too easy?</b></font>

216
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:35,804
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I didn't say you have to surpass those times.
It's not good to be faster or slower.</b></font>

217
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What?</b></font>

218
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:42,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Whether it's uphill or downhill,

00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If you think it's easy, 
you're seriously mistaken.</b></font>

221
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,864

226
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:26,414

227
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:30,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But what's the meaning 
behind the special training?</b></font>

228
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:35,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That training was slightly modified for Keisuke</b></font>

229
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:39,774

233
00:18:55,214 --> 00:19:02,014

234
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:06,844

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Suppose you lost 4 seconds until the overtake
point, you must recover exactly 4 seconds.</b></font>

240
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:39,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And you do that with the internal clock in
your body, instead of relying on a stopwatch.</b></font>

241
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:44,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Is that possible?</b></font>

242
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:50,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not right away, but you'll be able to,
depending on how you train yourself.</b></font>

243
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:53,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's the traditional way of driving practice.</b></font>

244
00:19:53,994 --> 00:20:00,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You attain an abundance of information
through repetitious simple training.</b></font>

245
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:03,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And then your internal sensor 
will become sensitive to time.</b></font>

246
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:12,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've gotta control the gas pedal 
depression in a number of small steps.</b></font>

247
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:17,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's much harder to control your desired 
speed than trying to drive as fast as possible.</b></font>

248
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:32,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The great thing about Keisuke is that once he sets his
mind to it, he'll finish a task without any compromise.</b></font>

249
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He drives every day,
except for Project D's race days.</b></font>

250
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:38,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Every day?!</b></font>

251
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:44,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As the gap between the desired
and actual times narrowed</b></font>

252
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:50,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>he began to understand what 
made his time too fast or too slow.</b></font>

253
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:56,704
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The daily report made him create 
a habit of analyzing things rationally</b></font>

254
00:20:56,704 --> 00:21:01,394
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>which added a logical foundation
to his intuitive driving style.</b></font>

255
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:09,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He must be aware of an unexpected
side effect of the training, as well.</b></font>

256
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:22,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Brother told me the special training
was for my accelerator work.</b></font>

257
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But that's not exactly true.</b></font>

258
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:31,204
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There's something else I need, in order to
continue winning in this tough Kanagawa area.</b></font>

259
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:35,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Watch me, Brother.
I've come to realize what it is.</b></font>

260
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:40,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Remember our first battle in Kanagawa, Fumihiro?</b></font>

261
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:47,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The Lan Evo of Team 246? 
Keisuke accelerated in the mid section and won.</b></font>

262
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:52,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His tire management in the
second half was splendid</b></font>

263
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:57,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but I'm more interested in his
refined acceleration when needed.</b></font>

264
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:02,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Speed is what I meant by a side effect.</b></font>

265
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:08,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Tire management skills specialized for
mountain passes, and sense of time.</b></font>

266
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:16,284
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The real reason I made Keisuke train that way was
to make him attain those two skills at a high level.</b></font>

267
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:25,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Strangely enough, the menu
was designed to slow him down</b></font>

268
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:29,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but it helped him drive
a lot faster in the end.</b></font>

269
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:35,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And today's strategy is to make
the best use of that side effect.</b></font>

270
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:44,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In other words, Keisuke will engage in a head to
head fight against a racing driver in a sprint battle?</b></font>

271
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:48,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I won't let Fujiwara steal the show.</b></font>

272
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:54,004
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'll build the legend of Project D,
the best of the Kanto area.</b></font>

273
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,054
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not too shabby.</b></font>

274
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:08,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's trying to catch me off guard by altering
the throttle opening at the exit of every corner.</b></font>

275
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:18,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Opening the throttle randomly between 85-90%, he's
gauging vehicle distance to decide when to accelerate.</b></font>

276
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:29,354
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I didn't expect him to pull off such a trick. 
He's much better than I thought.</b></font>

277
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:35,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The first half of the hill climb battle is almost over.</b></font>

278
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:40,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What did you think of our 
opponent this time around?</b></font>

279
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:42,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's your actual impression?</b></font>

280
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:48,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When it comes to speed,
race car drivers are really fast.</b></font>

281
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:53,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In my race, I was able to pull away once.</b></font>

282
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:59,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I put on a spurt at 100%, believing that
I must outrun my opponent from there</b></font>

283
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but I was caught, and felt pressured.</b></font>

284
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:08,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I panic when I lose
in speed at a critical moment.</b></font>

285
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:10,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I understand that.</b></font>

286
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:14,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But Keisuke is different from me.</b></font>

287
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,594
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>How do I put it?</b></font>

288
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:20,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keisuke has an aura</b></font>

289
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:27,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>which makes me glad that he's on my side,

290
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:32,874
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There are many fast drivers, but

291
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:56,424
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's begun.</b></font>

292
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:58,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm counting on you, Keisuke.</b></font>

294
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,734
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And Project D won't be complete.</b></font>

295
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:36,604
