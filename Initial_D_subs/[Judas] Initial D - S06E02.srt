67
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:54,557
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When we drive the mountain passes in Lan Evos,
we basically think of WRC drivers as the ideal.</b></font>

68
00:07:55,977 --> 00:08:01,407
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You make a relatively large yaw motion at
the entrance of a corner, and turn by drifting.</b></font>

69
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:11,527
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Because of the nature of rally racing,
such a style is reasonable, and safer, too.</b></font>

70
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:18,537
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You mean that steering is only a trigger,
and you turn by using the accelerator.</b></font>

71
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,537
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Isn't that safer?</b></font>

72
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:27,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But having a safety margin means
losing something elsewhere.</b></font>

73
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:33,117
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Closed-circuit drivers don't drive like that.</b></font>

74
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:39,057
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They'll let the tires grip by using the full
potential of the tires, because you can go faster.</b></font>

75
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:48,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But because you can't see what's ahead in a
mountain pass, I believe the rally style is better.</b></font>

76
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:54,487
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Those who are fast on mountain
passes all drive like that.</b></font>

77
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara is no exception.</b></font>

78
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In fact, he likes to swing his car around.</b></font>

79
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,557
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But Sidewinder's Eight-Six is different.</b></font>

80
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Wait a sec, Kyoichi!</b></font>

81
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,507
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Your explanation is getting complicated.</b></font>

82
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:14,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He can't understand it, huh?</b></font>

83
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is just my hypothesis, but</b></font>

84
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:27,337
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If there was a driver who could drive the mountain pass with lots of blind corners as if it was a closed circuit</b></font>

85
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:33,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If there was a driver who knows the course
so thoroughly, beyond anyone's imagination</b></font>

86
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:41,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara Takumi's drifting style made
him the fastest in northern Kanto</b></font>

87
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,687
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but he won't be able to beat the boring
gripping style with his drifting style.</b></font>

88
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:49,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Do you understand?
There's a stylistic issue here.</b></font>

89
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,507
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Is that so? Dammit!</b></font>

90
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That said, I didn't understand any of it.</b></font>

91
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:22,407
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's not particularly fast
during the entry or the exit.</b></font>

92
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's fast during the entire sequence.</b></font>

93
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Just a little</b></font>

94
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:33,907
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's only a little, but I'm
falling behind in the corners.</b></font>

95
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:40,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In most corners of a mountain pass, you can't
see the entire curve from the entrance to the exit.</b></font>

96
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:47,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No matter how experienced they are, drivers
instinctively maintain some sort of safety margin.</b></font>

97
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:52,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This issue is unrelated
to the level of technique.</b></font>

98
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:56,307
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But Shinji doesn't have that
kind of hesitation at all.</b></font>

99

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I feel like he can see the exit of the corner,

100
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,007

103

104
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:41,307

108
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:10,167
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In each corner, there's a slight elevation change from the entrance to the exit, and the change of radius.</b></font>

109

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Also any minor damage in the asphalt, the flow

00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,577
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not good at all.</b></font>

123
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,307
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's a strange sight, isn't it?</b></font>

124
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The finale of this big event turned out to be an
unexpected battle between two Eight-Sixes.</b></font>

125
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's your take, Daiki?</b></font>

126
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara is better at braking.</b></font>

127
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He can delay his braking point.</b></font>

128
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The way he uses heel-and-toe engine braking to slow down his car is at a professional level.</b></font>

129
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:51,087
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>On the other hand, the leading Eight-Six
driver's corner entry control is loose</b></font>

130
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:54,367
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>and he's using heel-and-toe
just for the hell of it.</b></font>

131
00:15:56,587 --> 00:16:02,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But his brake release point was
so perfect that it gave me chills.</b></font>

132
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:06,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He must know this course very well.</b></font>

133
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:13,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Just like you, the braking artist, Daiki.
Your observation is unique.</b></font>

134
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:18,887
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even through my eyes, Fujiwara's racing
technique seems to have improved.</b></font>

135
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:22,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even so, he didn't seem
to have any margin.</b></font>

136
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,907
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No margin?</b></font>

137
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:29,927
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That means the pace is fast.</b></font>

138
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:41,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even if they drive at the same pace,
Fujiwara has a smaller margin</b></font>

139
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>because he's fighting to the fullest.</b></font>

140
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:49,767
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>On the other hand, his opponent's
driving is gentle and smooth.</b></font>

141
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:53,297
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That will put less stress
on the tires and the car.</b></font>

142
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:57,317
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's amazing that he doesn't
have to swing his rear end.</b></font>

143
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,757
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His style is totally
different from Todo School's.</b></font>

144
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:04,387
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This won't go well for Project D.</b></font>

145
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,907
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>At this rate, it will be
Fujiwara's tires that wear out first.</b></font>

146
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:25,497
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His braking from a straightaway is fairly loose.</b></font>

147
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,817
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's almost like how I was last year.</b></font>

148
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,197
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then why?</b></font>

149
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:39,297
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm struggling to keep up
after a series of corners.</b></font>

150
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's making the difference?</b></font>

151
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,827
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The potential of the two Eight-Sixes?</b></font>

152
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It can't be.</b></font>

153
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:57,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This car's maintenance is handled by Ryosuke
and Matsumoto, the best team out there.</b></font>

154
00:17:58,637 --> 00:17:59,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That means</b></font>

155
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:03,247
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm the one losing here.</b></font>

156
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,447
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If I fall behind in the next hair-pin curve, things will get even worse.</b></font>

157
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,887
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What, why?</b></font>

158
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't believe this.</b></font>

159
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:56,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What is he thinking?!</b></font>

160
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:03,487
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I want to see them</b></font>

161
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:09,927
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There were wings on the back of your car.</b></font>

162
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I want to see the wings again.</b></font>

163
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,547
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Those breathtakingly cool wings.</b></font>

164
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I won't be able to see them from out in front.</b></font>

165
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:23,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Show them to me again.</b></font>

166
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,247
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Did you see that, Kobayakawa?</b></font>

167
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:40,367
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, he gave way.</b></font>

168
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's one hell of a crazy
move that you never see.</b></font>

169
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:48,267
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Maybe he doesn't understand

170
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What the hell?!</b></font>

171
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He lit the blinkers and fell behind?!</b></font>

172
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,077
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Are you serious?</b></font>

173
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:59,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I heard it from a record keeper

174
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,767
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't know what's going on.</b></font>

175
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,157
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>My bad feeling turned out to be true.</b></font>

176
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,877
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He didn't understand
why we chose the lead.</b></font>

177
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,417
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Or perhaps, he doesn't know

178
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,937
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm very sorry.</b></font>

179
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:24,187
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Once the positions are switched, it's the
end unless he overtakes somewhere.</b></font>

180

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh no, he'll lose.</b></font>

187
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:53,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Beats me.</b></font>

188
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:54,907

205
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:16,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In other words, this reckless act is out of

220
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,707
