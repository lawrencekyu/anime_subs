121
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>A little hard for me to come out...</i></b></font>

122

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>He's so smooth, it's like he's gliding...</i>

123
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:23,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>But why am I able to keep</i>

124
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:28,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>Because there's less of a slope here</i>

125
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:32,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>I can't believe that would be the only reason.</i>

126
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:41,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b><i>My heart is pounding. I'm as excited as when</i>

133
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,764
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>How was it, Nobuhiko?</b></font>

134

137

138
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:07,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>After all, we took it as far as the fifth race.</b></font>

139
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,554
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Because this course has a mix

140
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If it were a purely downhill course,</b></font>

141
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I wonder whether the race

142
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:18,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Jeez! Way to hit a person where it hurts.</b></font>

143
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:22,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The Eight-Six's downhill certainly

144
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,534
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But...</b></font>

145
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:27,704
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>...there was one thing that bothered me.</b></font>

146
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:32,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I felt like the driver of that Eight-Six

147
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Why would he do that?</b></font>

148
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:41,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't know. Maybe I'm just

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Thanks to what he showed me,

151
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,484

152
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>To beat the Eight-Six?!</b></font>

153
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:54,154
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's right. The one and only way.</b></font>

154
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A time trial race?</b></font>

155
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:10,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's incredible, huh? His acceleration.</b></font>

156
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:14,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I wonder what kind of course record he'll set.</b></font>

157
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:17,984
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But today's race was just the opening
