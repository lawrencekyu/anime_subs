00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:47,634
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Really?</b></font>

241
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:51,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It wasn't really meant for fog.</b></font>

242
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:55,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But our solution to temporary low visibility
at night in the rain will come in handy.</b></font>

243
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:01,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Listen, Sakamoto, if you feel fear,
ease up on the gas pedal.</b></font>

244
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:05,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's the basics of the Zero mindset.</b></font>

245
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:10,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When we're petrified with fear,
we tend to panic.</b></font>

246
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:14,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If you feel fear, you've
already made a mistake.</b></font>

247
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:18,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When it happens, release the gas
pedal, and calm yourself down.</b></font>

248
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:23,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You're risking your life if you
drive with fear. Don't forget that.</b></font>

249
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:30,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>From here on, it's a fight against fear.</b></font>

250
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:33,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Extra emotions will dictate your driving style.</b></font>

251
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:37,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's this uncomfortable feeling?</b></font>

252
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,754
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A part of me is telling me
to ease up on the throttle.</b></font>

253
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:45,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But another self is refusing,
keeping my foot on the pedal.</b></font>

254
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:47,764
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That contradiction is causing stress.</b></font>

255
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I can't lose.</b></font>

256
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:55,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What I need now is focus and</b></font>

257
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>a strong desire to win.</b></font>

258
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:02,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's that fighting spirit</b></font>

259
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>which I normally deny.</b></font>

260
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:09,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Project D consists of pure street attackers.</b></font>

261
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Whether it's fog or whatever, we'll
do what we need to in order to win.</b></font>

262
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His line is different.</b></font>

263
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:22,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Clearly different from
earlier in the battle.</b></font>

264
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:27,034
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can't believe this. Am I not
racing with the mindset of Zero?</b></font>

265
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:32,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can tell from his line that he's
concerned about oncoming traffic.</b></font>

266
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:37,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In this visibility, there's no way
you can avoid an oncoming car.</b></font>

267
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:42,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He must have arranged a number of
course marshals at the blind corners.</b></font>

268
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,284
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But now they're useless because of this fog.</b></font>

269
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:48,074
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Brother's prediction was dead on.</b></font>

270
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:01,004
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not yet</b></font>

271
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This place should do it.</b></font>

272
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:12,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is where the average speed suddenly
increases after a series of slow sections.</b></font>

273
00:22:14,094 --> 00:22:16,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If the fog forms as
my brother predicted</b></font>

274
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:20,504
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>anyone would hesitate to step on the
gas no matter how strong minded he is.</b></font>

275
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:27,954
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The idea is to pick an overtake location and
practice repeatedly until you can visualize it.</b></font>

276
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:33,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't know how thick the fog will become</b></font>

277
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:38,954
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but I've practiced until I could
trace the line with my eyes closed.</b></font>

278
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:43,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Your role during the actual race is important.
I'm counting on you, Kenta.</b></font>

279
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:55,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keisuke went back and forth on this
section with his eyes open and closed.</b></font>

280
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:59,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That was how he trained to avoid
dropping his pace in poor visibility.</b></font>

281
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:04,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Is it okay to believe that the
heavens are on Keisuke's side?</b></font>

282
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:06,754
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Wasn't fog this thick within his expectations?</b></font>

283
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:14,854
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Passing in this fog sounds so suitable for
the bold Keisuke, but it's too dangerous.</b></font>

284
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:22,724
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Their exhaust sounds are close.

285
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:27,204
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But what's more important
is any sound from behind.</b></font>

286
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:32,874
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I have a great responsibility.
For Keisuke sake, I can't make a mistake.</b></font>

290
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:03,904
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It looked like a yellow fireball to me, Mom.</b></font>

291
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:13,284
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We'll leave the woods and reach a hilly area soon.</b></font>

00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Once the fog gets thinner, I should

293
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,044
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then I'll be able to let out my frustration</b></font>

294
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>at full throttle.</b></font>

296
