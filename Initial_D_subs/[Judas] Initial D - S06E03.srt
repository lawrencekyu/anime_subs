75
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,547
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Probably so.</b></font>

89
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:36,307
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm a little disappointed.</b></font>

90
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:42,757
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If I can't see them,
it's pointless to stay behind you.</b></font>

91
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:53,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's hard to drive behind Shinji
because people lose their rhythm.</b></font>

92
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:59,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's probably because of his unusually fast entry into the corners and his own unique rhythm.</b></font>

93
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:06,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It tends to make skilled drivers

97
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:29,407

100
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:43,207

111
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:46,527
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The local Sidewinder team would normally stick with

112
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,507

157
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,567
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes. When he's focused,

161

167
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:11,707

170
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,857

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No one can understand Shinji's natural talent.</b></font>

172
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:34,297

179
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,717

180
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:31,437

181
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,437
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Dammit!</b></font>

185
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:47,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's driving for more than his own sake.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah. That's right.</b></font>

193
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:14,207

194
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,307

196
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,657
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can see the situation.</b></font>

197

198
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:34,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But even at high speed, he should have

200
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:46,857
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>he probably didn't block that reckless move even

201
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:50,487
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That scenario sounds more plausible.</b></font>

202
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,007
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not bad.</b></font>

211
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:31,757

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's at a serious disadvantage.</b></font>

222
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:45,327

223
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:52,907
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sayuki, do you remember the battle

230
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,707

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Nobody has ever kept up

244
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:59,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Wow, what's with him?</b></font>

245
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:06,327
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No way. That was the first time

246
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,357
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Looks tough, but I can make it.</b></font>

247
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What?</b></font>

248
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,897
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Why isn't he falling back?</b></font>

249
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:24,437
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm doing my best, but he isn't falling back.</b></font>

250
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh man.</b></font>

251
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:31,567
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I just heard a report from the third hairpin.</b></font>

252
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:38,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As you know, it's a really

253

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not difficult to climb there</b></font>

254
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:47,447
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but when you go down, it gets more and more dangerous as you try to tackle it harder.</b></font>

255
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:51,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The guardrail there is incredibly damaged.</b></font>

259
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:18,397
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara Takumi stayed right behind him

260
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:21,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This must have had a huge impact on Shinji.</b></font>

261
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:26,327
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Based on the section time,

262
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,807
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is a good sign.</b></font>

263
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:29,407
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Huh?</b></font>

264
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:35,597
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A genius instantly surpassed the world Shinji's

265
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:38,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara Takumi is persistent.</b></font>

266
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:44,257
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Excuse me for saying this</b></font>

267
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:48,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but you've changed in a good way, Hojo.</b></font>

268
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:55,887
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You seemed so obsessed with victory

271
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,407
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Maybe so.</b></font>

272
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:14,457
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I lost my battle.</b></font>

273
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:16,607
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That must be when I lost my obsession.</b></font>

274
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:22,207
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It'd be a waste if you end this battle

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Everyone who has participated in this event

278
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:47,347
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm rather surprised that he showed up
at the starting line, instead of running away.</b></font>

279
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:54,957
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>From how he looked this morning,

280
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:03,307
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He must be scared, because he's wimpy

281
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:08,107
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Once he starts racing,

282
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,707
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>and can't make any excuses.</b></font>

283

288

289
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,807
