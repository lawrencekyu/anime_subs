119
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:41,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>...I thought that using your own

120

121
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:50,144
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Look, don't put too much stock into this, Daiki.</b></font>

122
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:52,974

129
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,434
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>makes it clear that

130
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,504
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I guess.</b></font>

131
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:24,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This showoff manner of theirs is inexcusable!</b></font>

132
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:29,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I want to show them that there

134
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

135
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,694
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Say, Ryosuke...</b></font>

136
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've been thinking about this for a while,</b></font>

137
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:48,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>and don't you think the D homepage

00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:52,274

142
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:03,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes. Our opponents will

146

149
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes, it would be.</b></font>

150
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:35,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I have yet to inform anyone of it.</b></font>

151
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:37,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's pretty shifty, Ryosuke.</b></font>

152
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:42,384
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Okay, so tell me. What does the "D" stand for?</b></font>

153
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:44,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You'll know soon enough, Fumihiro.</b></font>

154
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,984

155
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:52,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>When this project is complete.</b></font>

156
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It looks like they'll clear out

157
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:33,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The course will be reserved just for us.</b></font>

158
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Reserved or not, there'll be a

159
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:41,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No, this road is still under construction,

160
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:45,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It looks like there won't be any

161

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Under construction...</b></font>

162
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:51,884
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So that's why. Even just watching the video,
it seemed like an incredible course.</b></font>

163
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:56,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There's some serious height

164
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:59,594
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's newly paved and the
roads have plenty of width,</b></font>

165

173
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,814

174
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:56,854
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It will?</b></font>

177
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,304

178
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:16,794

179
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,514
