237
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:11,724

240
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:18,264

253
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:09,424
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The thing is, just think about it.</b></font>

254
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:15,424
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Say one day Takumi's in the Eight-Six

257
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:30,344
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Th-That's rough...</b></font>

258
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:35,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So he keeps trying to catch an opponent

259
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:40,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Before, the Eight-Six was
the absolute standard for him...</b></font>

260
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:45,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But havin' that one standard become <i>two</i>

261
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,324
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>How can I put it?</b></font>

262
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:51,694
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>To exaggerate a bit, his entire view

263
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:54,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As if the line connectin'

264
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:57,504
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>with an endless number of other points.</b></font>

265
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:58,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Huh...</b></font>

266
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:01,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His reasonin' skills will improve.</b></font>

267
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:05,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>More and more, he'll understand

268
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You get enough knowledge and experience,

270
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:20,554
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And of course, what he'll do goin' forward.</b></font>

271
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Awesome, awesome!</b></font>

278
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,694

281
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:49,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think it's because of the wide body,
