148
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:08,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It must be because of the muscle training.</b></font>

149

160
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:27,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>From a strategic point of view, I think
braking is most important on the downhill.</b></font>

161
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:35,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Stopping distance increases dramatically on the downhill

164
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,254
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>you can only rely on your refined intuition.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Landmarks are useless.</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm constantly surprised by the

167
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:14,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Fujiwara's braking sense is exceptional.</b></font>

168
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:23,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's why he can keep winning on the downhill

169
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:28,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not something you can

170
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:30,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's definitely a natural.</b></font>

171
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:38,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You can figure out your opponent's driving skills by

172
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:42,174
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You're right.
That's not so difficult.</b></font>

173
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>And it's even more true between
two drivers with similar skills.</b></font>

174
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:49,274
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Conversely, hiding skills can be the key.</b></font>

175
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You show your true braking skills when</b></font>

176
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:56,854
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>you decide to settle the match.</b></font>

177
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:23,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I was late, only a little, but definitely late.</b></font>

178
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,944
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That hard braking from the long straightaway.</b></font>

00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:36,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even if it was just that one time,

180
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:41,324
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Incredible entry!</b></font>

181
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The gap with the Eight-Six is getting wider!</b></font>

182
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm using everything

183
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm in a dangerous zone.</b></font>

184
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're getting closer.</b></font>

185
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,834
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're almost at the corner.</b></font>

186
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:26,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Looks quite dangerous.</b></font>

187
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:31,644
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The cars of that era tend to behave like
that when their suspension is stiffened.</b></font>

188
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You can say it's very 86 like.</b></font>

189
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:41,504
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The car's seriously tuned to be the very best in the stages

190
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:45,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So there's a meaning to the
choice of using the Eight-Six.</b></font>

191
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,874
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's something Ryosuke would come up with.</b></font>

192
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:54,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He knows what he's doing based on the fact that
the car doesn't have any aerodynamic parts, but</b></font>

193
00:17:56,514 --> 00:18:03,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>the level of competition is so high that the cars

194
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:12,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>People say the GT wing only works on the circuit,

195
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:16,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Aerodynamics might decide
the outcome of this race.</b></font>

196
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:32,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Basically, Mazda's rear wheel drive cars are designed
to have the roll axis a little forward of the mid point.</b></font>

197
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:40,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The FD is no exception, but the Roadster in
particular gives you a better handling feel

198
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:46,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But if you push it harder, it tends to over steer
because of the lack of load to the rear.</b></font>

199
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:51,024
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It becomes an unavoidable
issue when tuning a Roadster.</b></font>

200
00:18:56,224 --> 00:19:03,204
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There are many different approaches, but you can't
eliminate the car's natural over steering tendency.</b></font>

201
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,534
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I wonder how they dealt with it.</b></font>

202
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:10,344
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Over steering on the downhill is bad.</b></font>

203
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:14,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Instead, you can drive faster by under steering.</b></font>

204
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:18,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Knowing our opponents, their car
must have been perfectly tuned, but</b></font>

205
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:31,804
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If something destroys that balance,
Fujiwara will have a chance.</b></font>

206
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can't catch him, but</b></font>

207
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:50,134
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>the gap hasn't widened, even though

00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:56,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's almost a miracle that you've kept up with me.</b></font>

209
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,874
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>From this point on,

210
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:05,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No need to play a guessing game.
