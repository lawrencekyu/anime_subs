00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:14,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I saw wings.</b></font>

125
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:15,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Huh? Wings?</b></font>

126
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:19,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>On the white one in the lead.</b></font>

127
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:24,224
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>On the Eight-Six? 
It didn't have a wing.</b></font>

128
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No, I didn't mean that.</b></font>

129
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I saw</b></font>

130
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>white wings like on birds.</b></font>

131
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Alright, I can do this.</b></font>

132
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:51,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's not slow, but not as fast as I thought.</b></font>

133
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:56,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's only natural because of the fog.</b></font>

134
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:01,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm gonna give you a hard time by 
putting pressure on you from behind.</b></font>

135
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,154
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I was absolutely right when
I chose to be the chaser.</b></font>

136
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:10,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You told Fujiwara something
before the start, didn't you?</b></font>

137
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's your strategy?</b></font>

138
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:18,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not exactly a strategy. Fujiwara
can win thanks to these conditions.</b></font>

139
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then what did you tell him?</b></font>

140
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:26,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>An instruction about not giving too much data to our opponent. My mind is already on the next race.</b></font>

141
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:32,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You mean the final battle against Sidewinder?</b></font>

142
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yeah, you could say that.</b></font>

143
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:42,724
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But before that, I have a battle of my own.</b></font>

144
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He picked up the pace.</b></font>

145
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:12,054
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even though he's not a local, he can 
see the course in this poor visibility.</b></font>

146
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:17,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This isn't about technique.
He's got good driving sense.</b></font>

147
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:22,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But he won't be able to 
continue this pace for very long.</b></font>

148
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:27,214
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even that tough Ikeda lost his concentration.</b></font>

149
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keep trying as hard as you like.</b></font>

150
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:35,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You'll make a mistake in the second half. 
That's when I'll make my move.</b></font>

151
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:56,354
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If you ask me, I'd say the result was
obvious even before the race began.</b></font>

152
00:12:56,354 --> 00:13:00,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But the opponent's car is so well tuned.</b></font>

153
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:04,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm a Silvia owner myself, 
so I can tell by just looking.</b></font>

154
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:12,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think the balance of turning, braking, and
acceleration are better than Fujiwara's Eight-Six.</b></font>

155
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:18,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Normally, he'd be at a disadvantage.</b></font>

156
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What do you mean by "normally"?</b></font>

157
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:25,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Like driving on a circuit on a sunny day?</b></font>

158
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:29,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If that's the case, vehicle
potential makes a difference.</b></font>

159
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:37,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But in conditions like these,
it's all about the driver.</b></font>

160
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:46,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>My brother's blind training was inspired
from Fujiwara's natural cluelessness.</b></font>

161
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:51,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Not just visibility, but as all
the conditions deteriorate</b></font>

162
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:56,054

163
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:58,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So much so that I hate it.</b></font>

164
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I keep telling you the same
thing over and over, Kenta.</b></font>

167
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:19,654
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The way this guy's stomping 
on the accelerator is scary.</b></font>

168
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:25,544

169
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:32,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What kind of nerves does he have?

170
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:40,374

171
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:46,684
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No thanks. Nobody can be sure

172
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:48,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't want to be involved.</b></font>

173
00:14:53,414 --> 00:15:00,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even if I fall behind a little during braking, I should be able to recover my loss during acceleration.</b></font>

174
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:08,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm not going with you. Go ahead and
disappear from the course alone.</b></font>

175
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You went in way too fast!

176
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:24,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What the hell?!</b></font>

177
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Is my sense of speed dull because of the fog?</b></font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sorry, Matsumoto, but this is a fate I can't avoid.</b></font>

250
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:52,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No, it's true, Keisuke.</b></font>

253
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>A wing?</b></font>
