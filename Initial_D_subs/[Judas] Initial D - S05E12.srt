241
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:52,224
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It has a clear advantage in terms of section time.</b></font>

242
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:59,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's because of better braking due to the mid ship
layout, and the NA engine's immediate response.</b></font>

243
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:02,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The first key point is section 2.</b></font>

244

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If we can surprise the FD driver

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>he'll wear down his tires

246

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If we hold on until section 4

249
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:26,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Given the fact that Hojo chose the front position, that must be his scenario.</b></font>

250
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,934
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The battle will take a new turn from there.</b></font>

251
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't understand.</b></font>

252
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:40,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We used to drive just for fun,

253
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There's something strange

254
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:47,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'd better stop thinking so hard.</b></font>

255
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:50,554
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I just have to show

256
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>with this car.</b></font>

257
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He's started to show sharper movements.</b></font>

258
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't like this.</b></font>

259
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:07,764
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He suddenly pulls away even

260
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>which is exactly what my brother predicted.</b></font>

261
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:14,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He gives off the same

262
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'd be panicked if I hadn't anticipated this.</b></font>

263
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:23,164
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But this isn't where the real battle takes place.</b></font>

264
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:33,354
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He might be shocked by
the NSX's speed more or less.</b></font>

265
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:39,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The hill climb of this vehicle class was 
always fought between turbo charged cars.</b></font>

266
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:45,404
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The NSX is the only exception, as far as domestic sports cars are concerned.</b></font>

267
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:51,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The expensive and large engine is
mounted in the middle of the chassis</b></font>

268
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:55,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>which gives the car superb
 handling on a twisty course.</b></font>

269
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The high cornering speed
of the mid ship layout</b></font>

270
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:04,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>and the fast cornering exit speed
of the NA engine's linear response.</b></font>

271
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:09,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The butt kicking acceleration of the NA engine will become even handier on public roads</b></font>

272
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:13,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>with so many more short
 corners than circuits have.</b></font>

273
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:17,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I don't think he's upset,</b></font>

274
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:24,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>because he's familiar with the type of driver who

275
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,894
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You mean Fujiwara?</b></font>

276
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:34,784
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I think Hojo Gou's NSX driving
style is similar to Fujiwara's.</b></font>

277
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:38,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>If you adapt that type 
of driving to the hill climb.</b></font>

278
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,534
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's a difficult opponent to deal with.</b></font>

279
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's true.</b></font>

280
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:49,494
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I knew early on that our
opponent would be using an NSX.</b></font>

281
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:53,254
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not like Keisuke and I just 
sat back and waited for today.</b></font>

282
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,474
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We have our own trump card.</b></font>

283
00:20:57,474 --> 00:21:02,574
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keisuke, use all the skills you've
learned up until today in this race.</b></font>

284
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:30,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't get it.
What did they come here for?</b></font>

285
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:34,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even women like them.</b></font>

286
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:38,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's odd to see someone like
them in a place like this.</b></font>

287
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:45,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What should I do?</b></font>

288
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:48,854
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I can't just show up like nothing's happened.</b></font>

289
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The meeting time is long past.</b></font>

290
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:54,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But I can't go home either.</b></font>

291
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Mom would be angrier than Hojo.</b></font>

292
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:05,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Why am I always like this, running away at the
most critical moment and disappointing Mom?</b></font>

293
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:11,794
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But the person who's most disappointed is...</b></font>

294
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:15,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Hey, young man!</b></font>

295
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:18,744
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What's the matter?

296
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,504

297
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:23,814
