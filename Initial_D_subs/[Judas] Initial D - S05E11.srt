197
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:21,364

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Focus on the FD.</b></font>

242
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:30,584
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Obtain as much information on its section times
to determine how its fighting potential varies.</b></font>

243
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,594
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Alright, I'll arrange that.</b></font>

244
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:42,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Oh man, our boss is nervous.</b></font>

245
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,304
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He fell for our opponent's diversion strategy.</b></font>

246
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:53,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They shouldn't have changed the
specs very drastically at this point.</b></font>

247
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:57,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That FD is a completely balanced machine.</b></font>

248
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I won't be tricked, Takahashi Ryosuke.</b></font>

249
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:07,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is our match of intelligence.
You're worthy of being my opponent.</b></font>

250
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Hey, Mister Zero.</b></font>

251
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:20,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Well, if it isn't the hot blooded 246 guy.</b></font>

252
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It has finally come to the
moment of truth, hasn't it?</b></font>

253
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:28,174
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I was expecting you to stop them.</b></font>

254
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sorry that we weren't good enough.</b></font>

255
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:40,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Takahashi Keisuke</b></font>

256
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,274
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>How do you rate him?</b></font>

257
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:47,924
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>His accelerator technique on
a half wet road was exceptional.</b></font>

258
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:54,454
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He managed to control the traction of the
rear tires, as if they were a part of his body.</b></font>

259
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:59,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Besides his concentration right at the moment of attack,
his ability to switch mindsets quickly is also impressive.</b></font>

260
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:06,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He reaches beyond the scope of Zero Theory,
like a fighter jet boosted by an afterburner.</b></font>

261
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:11,854
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>In other words, he's like you.</b></font>

262
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Like me?</b></font>

263
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:18,064
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>The type of driver who shows his eagerness for
victory, who has skills and understands the theory.</b></font>

264
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:20,774
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But in the end, what
matters most is the spirit.</b></font>

265
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:24,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You and Takahashi Keisuke
are alike on that account.</b></font>

266
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,844
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't feel bad hearing that.</b></font>

267
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:39,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What kind of driver is Fujiwara Takumi?</b></font>

268
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:45,034
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I want to hear your opinion since
you witnessed his true potential.</b></font>

269
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,714
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's difficult to describe him.</b></font>

270
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,484
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's like a black hole.</b></font>

271
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Black hole?</b></font>

272
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:56,224
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He has a wide margin to be able to absorb a lot.</b></font>

273
00:21:56,224 --> 00:22:03,104
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He appears to have his own concrete policy, but in
reality, he has no color. He's transparent and flexible.</b></font>

274
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:11,264
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He improves race after race, so he's probably
different from when he raced against me.</b></font>

275
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:15,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>So you think highly of him,
almost raving about him.</b></font>

276
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:20,534
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Then what's your prediction for this
battle between Project D and Sidewinder?</b></font>

277
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>You want to cut to
the point, don't you?</b></font>

278
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:24,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's unfortunate</b></font>

279
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:26,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>but Sidewinder will win.</b></font>

280
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:34,874
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've come to the same answer.
I really admire Takahashi Ryosuke.</b></font>

281
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:41,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As a member of a Kanagawa area team, I can't openly say
this, but my emotional side wants Project D to win.</b></font>

282
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:43,704
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But that's impossible.</b></font>

283
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sidewinder had plenty of time to prepare.</b></font>

284
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:51,334
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>As long as they have Kubo Eiji as their
strategist, they don't have any weaknesses.</b></font>

285
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:54,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But you can't really tell
until they start racing.</b></font>

286
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:58,624
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's not like Project D
has no chance of winning.</b></font>

287
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,564
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They have a slight chance due
to their drivers improvements.</b></font>

288
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:08,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I say their chance of winning
is one fifth, which is 20%.</b></font>

289
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:13,394
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>This is getting ridiculous.</b></font>

290
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:18,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I've never seen so many
guys with stopwatches before.</b></font>

291
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,994
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Don't they have anything else to do?</b></font>

292
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:27,234
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Speaking of which, we aren't that different, coming
all the way from Gunma only to race in Hakone.</b></font>

293
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Well, that's true.</b></font>

294
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:34,374
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>They're measuring my
section times pretty closely.</b></font>

295
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:38,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I don't like them trying
to figure out our strategy.</b></font>

296
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,914
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Should I add another camouflage pattern?</b></font>

297
00:23:41,914 --> 00:23:44,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>No, don't.
Just do as normal.</b></font>

298
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:50,554
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm afraid that you won't finish
practice if you try to do it differently.</b></font>

299
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,114
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>At this point, we don't
have to modify our style.</b></font>

300
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,614
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I got it.</b></font>

301
00:23:56,614 --> 00:24:02,184
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'll let them watch and learn the style of
Project D, the best of the northern Kanto area.</b></font>

302
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,604
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yup, that's exactly what I meant.</b></font>

303
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:07,504
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>What should I do then?</b></font>

304
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:11,004
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Set the suspension to pattern C,
and add 10 liters of gas.</b></font>

305
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:19,814
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Did you notice a huge number
of scouts throughout the course?</b></font>

306
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:24,864
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Keisuke told me about them,
and tons of stopwatches, too.</b></font>

307
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:25,524
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Here you go.</b></font>

308
00:24:27,294 --> 00:24:31,314
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>There're quite a lot of people out there,
but they aren't pushing the buttons.</b></font>

309
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:37,834
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I noticed those who were keeping
time and taking notes from the first round.</b></font>

310
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:42,464
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>I'm sure they're the same people.
I remember some of their faces.</b></font>

311
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:45,094
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But today none of them pressed
the button on their stopwatches.</b></font>

312
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:46,444
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Are you sure, Fujiwara?</b></font>

313
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Yes.</b></font>

314
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:51,014
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>He noticed such small
details while he was driving.</b></font>

315
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,514
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's what makes him so great.</b></font>

316
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:59,824
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>But what's the meaning of this, Ryosuke?
It contradicts what Keisuke said.</b></font>

317
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:03,664
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>That's fine. Both of
them are telling the truth.</b></font>

318
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:04,894
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It's going as planned.</b></font>

319
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:18,364
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="66"><b>{\an5}And so, the day of the final battle in Kanagawa has arrived...</b></font>

320

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.</b></font>

321
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:48,904
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Looking back at the path I've taken.</b></font>

322
00:25:48,904 --> 00:25:53,414
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.</b></font>

323
00:25:53,414 --> 00:26:03,214

324
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,754
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Countless number of memorable scenes.</b></font>

325
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:04,154
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>We lived through the hustle and bustle.</b></font>

326
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,494
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.</b></font>

327
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:09,294
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="73"><b>It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself</b></font>

330
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:23,004
